secure user authentication leveraging keystroke dynamics via wi-fi sensing,2022.0,0.0,"User authentication plays a critical role in access control of a man-machine system, where the knowledge factor, such as a personal identification number, constitutes the most widely used authentication element. However, knowledge factors are usually vulnerable to the spoofing attack. Recently, the inheritance factor, such as fingerprints, emerges as an efficient alternative resilient to malicious users, but it normally requires special equipment. To this end, in this article, we propose WiPass, a device-free authentication system only leveraging the pervasive Wi-Fi infrastructure to explore keystroke dynamics (manner and rhythm of keystrokes) captured by the channel state information to recognize legitimate users while rejecting spoofers. However, it remains an open challenge to characterize the behavioral features hidden in the human subtle motions, such as keystrokes. Therefore, we build a signal enhancement model using Ricean distribution to amplify user keystroke dynamics and a hybrid learning model for user authentication, which consists of two parts, i.e., convolutional neural network based feature extraction and support vector machine based classification. The former relies on visualizing the channel responses into time-series images to learn the behavioral features of keystrokes in energy and spectrum domains, whereas the latter exploits such behavioral features for user authentication. We prototype WiPass on the low-cost off-The-shelf Wi-Fi devices and verify its performance. Empirical results show that WiPass achieves on average 92.1% authentication accuracy, 5.9% false accept rate, and 6.3% false reject rate in three real environments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Behavioral features; channel state information (CSI); convolutional neural network (CNN); Ricean distribution; user authentication,"Gu Y., Wang Y., Wang M., Pan Z., Hu Z., Liu Z., Shi F., Dong M.",Article,secure user authentication leverage keystroke dynamic sense user authentication play critical role access control man machine knowledge factor personal identification number constitute widely authentication element knowledge factor usually vulnerable spoofing attack recently inheritance factor fingerprint emerge efficient alternative resilient malicious user normally require special equipment end article wipass device free authentication leverage pervasive infrastructure explore keystroke dynamics manner rhythm keystrokes capture channel state information recognize legitimate user reject spoofer remain open challenge characterize behavioral feature hide human subtle motion keystroke build signal enhancement model ricean distribution amplify user keystroke dynamics hybrid model user authentication consist part i.e. convolutional neural base feature extraction support vector machine base classification rely visualize channel response time series image behavioral feature keystroke energy spectrum domain exploit behavioral feature user authentication prototype wipass low cost shelf device verify empirical result wipass achieve average 92.1 authentication accuracy 5.9 false accept rate 6.3 false reject rate real environment behavioral feature channel state information csi convolutional neural cnn ricean distribution user authentication
data-driven based hvac optimisation approaches: a systematic literature review,2022.0,1.0,"Improving the energy efficiency of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems is crucial to reduce buildings’ energy costs and their carbon footprint. HVAC systems are complex, large-scale structures with pure lag time and high thermal inertia. Although traditionally, physical-based methods have been used to model, control and optimise them, data-driven approaches have demonstrated to be more application relevant, easier to compute and better suited to handle nonlinearities. Based only on measured or estimated data, data-driven approaches are highly dependent on the quality of the used data. In recent years, the advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), decreasing hardware cost, and improving data accessibility, have allowed the collection and storage of a large amount of high-quality building-related data, allowing the development of more accurate and robust data-driven approaches, making them gain great popularity in HVAC applications. In this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based on a database search is conducted to give an in-depth insight into the major challenges regarding modelling, controlling and optimising HVAC systems, making the especial focus on the capability of data-driven models to improve their energy performance while keeping the users’ comfort. The main results of the SLR highlight the importance of taking users’ needs into account when modelling, controlling and optimising HVAC systems to avoid their underutilisation. In particular, the increasing tendency to include users’ feedback into Model Predictive Control (MPC) loops and use easy-to-access technologies, such as WiFi and Smartphone Applications (Apps), to acquire users’ information suggests promising future research horizons. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Air conditioning (HVAC) systems; Artificial intelligence (AI); Data-driven based models; Heating; HVAC control; HVAC modelling; HVAC Optimisation; Ventilation,"Ala'raj M., Radi M., Abbod M.F., Majdalawieh M., Parodi M.",Review,drive base hvac optimisation approach systematic literature review improve energy efficiency heating ventilation air conditioning hvac system crucial reduce building energy cost carbon footprint hvac system complex large scale structure pure lag time high thermal inertia traditionally physical base method model control optimise drive approach demonstrate application relevant easy compute well suited handle nonlinearitie base measured estimate drive approach highly dependent quality recent year advance information communication technology ict decrease hardware cost improve accessibility allow collection storage large high quality building relate allow development accurate robust drive approach make gain great popularity hvac application systematic literature review slr base database search conduct depth insight major challenge modelling control optimise hvac system make especial focus capability drive model improve energy keep user comfort main result slr highlight importance take user need account modelling control optimise hvac system avoid underutilisation particular increase tendency include user feedback model predictive control mpc loop use easy access technology smartphone application apps acquire user information suggest promise future horizon elsevi ltd air conditioning hvac system artificial intelligence ai drive base model heating hvac control hvac modelling hvac optimisation ventilation
enabling efficient wifi-based occupant behavior recognition using insufficient samples,2022.0,0.0,"To launch energy-efficient and occupant-centric services in smart buildings, understanding occupant behavior is becoming an essential underpinning. Prevailing approaches mainly adopt ambient sensors, wearables or vision cameras, which suffer from insensitive perception, arduous deployment or privacy-leakage risks. Recently developed WiFi-based methods circumvent the above limitations, however, most of them require sufficient training samples and computational resources for a comprehensive understanding of behavior patterns. This scenario requires occupant cooperation and considerable energy consumption. In this paper, we propose the use of LT-WiOB, which is a lightweight triplet framework for WiFi-based occupant behavior recognition, that provides a cost-efficient and user-friendly solution. Technically, the novelties of LT-WiOB are threefold. For the insufficient data problem, an efficient triplet framework is presented to measure the embedding dependencies; it attempts to avoid the ambiguity of new samples from each class and allows only a few samples to be entered. Regarding inefficient computation, a lightweight convolutional module is specifically designed and implemented to reduce the model complexity. For unstable training, the triplet architecture is further enhanced by employing a novel triplet sampling strategy that creates useful triplet candidates. Extensive experiments were conducted for performance comparison under diverse environmental settings. The results showed that LT-WiOB realizes the best overall accuracy of 96.1% and achieves over 90% and 85% accuracy in the five-shot and one-shot conditions, respectively, with almost half of the computation cost being saved. These results verify the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed LT-WiOB model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Internet of things; Occupant behavior; Smart buildings; WiFi,"Zhou Q., Yang Q., Xing J.",Article,enable efficient base occupant behavior recognition insufficient sample launch energy efficient occupant centric service smart building understand occupant behavior essential underpinning prevail approach mainly adopt ambient sensor wearable vision camera suffer insensitive perception arduous deployment privacy leakage risk recently develop base method circumvent limitation require sufficient training sample computational resource comprehensive understanding behavior pattern scenario require occupant cooperation considerable energy consumption use lt wiob lightweight triplet framework base occupant behavior recognition provide cost efficient user friendly solution technically novelty lt wiob threefold insufficient problem efficient triplet framework present measure embed dependency attempt avoid ambiguity new sample class allow sample enter inefficient computation lightweight convolutional module specifically design implement reduce model complexity unstable training triplet architecture enhance employ novel triplet sampling strategy create useful triplet candidate extensive experiment conduct comparison diverse environmental setting result show lt wiob realize good overall accuracy 96.1 achieve accuracy shot shot condition respectively half computation cost save result verify efficiency feasibility propose lt wiob model elsevi ltd deep internet thing occupant behavior smart building
i-wknn: fast-speed and high-accuracy wifi positioning for intelligent sports stadiums,2022.0,0.0,"Based on various existing wireless fingerprint location algorithms in intelligent sports venues, a high-precision and fast indoor location algorithm improved weighted k-nearest neighbor (I-WKNN) is proposed. In order to meet the complex environment of sports venues and the demand of high-speed sampling, this paper proposes an AP selection algorithm for offline and online stages. Based on the characteristics of the signal intensity distribution in intelligent venues, an asymmetric Gaussian filter algorithm is proposed. This paper introduces the application of the positioning algorithm in the intelligent stadium system, and completes the data acquisition and real-time positioning of the stadium. Compared with traditional WKNN and KNN algorithms, the I-WKNN algorithm has advantages in fingerprint positioning database processing, environmental noise adaptability, real-time positioning accuracy and positioning speed, etc. The experimental results show that the I-WKNN algorithm has obvious advantages in positioning accuracy and positioning time in a complex noise environment and has obvious application potential in a smart stadium. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",AP selection; Asymmetric Gaussian filtering; I-WKNN algorithm; Intelligent stadium; WIFI fingerprint positioning,"Zhao Z., Lou Z., Wang R., Li Q., Xu X.",Article,wknn fast speed high accuracy positioning intelligent sport stadium base exist fingerprint location algorithm intelligent sport venue high precision fast indoor location algorithm improve weight k near neighbor wknn propose order meet complex environment sport venue demand high speed sampling propose ap selection algorithm offline online stage base characteristic signal intensity distribution intelligent venue asymmetric gaussian filter algorithm propose introduce application positioning algorithm intelligent stadium complete acquisition real time positioning stadium compare traditional wknn knn algorithm wknn algorithm advantage fingerprint positioning database processing environmental noise adaptability real time positioning accuracy position speed etc experimental result wknn algorithm obvious advantage position accuracy position time complex noise environment obvious application potential smart stadium elsevi ltd ap selection asymmetric gaussian filtering wknn algorithm intelligent stadium fingerprint positioning
using wifi connection counts and camera-based occupancy counts to estimate and predict building occupancy,2022.0,1.0,"Accurate occupancy information can help in optimizing the operation of building systems. To obtain this information, previous studies suggested using WiFi connection counts due to their strong correlation with occupancy counts. However, validating this correlation and investigating its variation have remained limited due to challenges regarding the collection of ground-truth data. Therefore, many studies suggested a single (fixed) value as the conversion factor of WiFi connection counts to actual occupancy counts based on short-term ground-truth data. This study addressed this gap by proposing a method for investigating the correlation between WiFi connection counts and actual building occupancy over a longer duration using continuous ground-truth data collected from camera-based occupancy counters. The proposed method focused on (i) identifying the influential features on this correlation and their effectiveness, as well as (ii) developing models to estimate real-time occupancy counts and to forecast day-ahead occupancy counts. To validate the proposed method, it was applied in a library building in Montréal, Canada with data collected between January and March 2020. Results showed time-related features including Hour of the day and Day of the week, as well as occupancy level influenced the correlation between Wifi and occupancy counts. Furthermore, the proposed models successfully estimated real-time occupancy counts with an average accuracy (R2) of 0.96 for weekdays and 0.98 for weekends, while day-ahead occupancy forecasting models had an average accuracy (R2) of 0.92 for weekdays and 0.82 for weekends. These findings provided a proof-of-concept for the proposed methodology, demonstrated the potential of using WiFi connection count for estimating/forecasting occupancy counts, and most importantly highlighted the important considerations that need to be addressed when using WiFi connection counts as a proxy for occupancy to optimize building operation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Building occupancy counts; Day-ahead occupancy prediction; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Real-time occupancy estimation; WiFi connection count,"Alishahi N., Ouf M.M., Nik-Bakht M.",Article,connection count camera base occupancy count estimate predict build occupancy accurate occupancy information help optimize operation building system obtain information previous study suggest connection count strong correlation occupancy count validate correlation investigate variation remain limited challenge collection ground truth study suggest single fix value conversion factor connection count actual occupancy count base short term ground truth address gap propose investigate correlation connection count actual building occupancy long duration continuous ground truth collect camera base occupancy counter propose focus identify influential feature correlation effectiveness ii develop model estimate real time occupancy count forecast day ahead occupancy count validate propose apply library building montréal canada collect january march result show time relate feature include hour day day week occupancy level influence correlation occupancy count furthermore propose model successfully estimate real time occupancy count average accuracy r2 0.96 weekday 0.98 weekend day ahead occupancy forecasting model average accuracy r2 0.92 weekday 0.82 weekend finding provide proof concept propose methodology demonstrate potential connection count estimate forecasting occupancy count importantly highlight important consideration need address connection count proxy occupancy optimize building operation elsevi b.v building occupancy count day ahead occupancy prediction energy efficiency machine real time occupancy estimation connection count
early fire detection: a new indoor laboratory dataset and data distribution analysis,2022.0,0.0,"Fire alarm systems are typically equipped with various sensors such as heat, smoke, and gas detectors. These provide fire alerts and notifications of emergency exits when a fire has been detected. However, such systems do not give early warning in order to allow appropriate action to be taken when an alarm is first triggered, as the fire may have already caused severe damage. This paper analyzes a new dataset gathered from controlled realistic fire experiments conducted in an indoor laboratory environment. The experiments were conducted in a controlled manner by triggering the source of fire using electrical devices and charcoal on paperboard, cardboard or clothing. Important data such as humidity, temperature, MQ139, Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) and eCO2 were collected using sensor devices. These datasets will be extremely valuable to researchers in the machine learning and data science communities interested in pursuing novel advanced statistical and machine learning techniques and methods for developing early fire detection systems. The analysis of the collected data demonstrates the possibility of using eCO2 and TVOC reading levels for early detection of smoldering fires. The experimental setup was based on Low-Power Wireless Area Networks (LPWAN), which can be used to reliably deliver fire-related data over long ranges without depending on the status of a cellular or WiFi Network. © 2022 by the authors.

wihf: gesture and user recognition with wifi,2022.0,2.0,"User identified gesture recognition is a fundamental step towards ubiquitous WiFi based sensing. We propose WiHF, which first simultaneously enables cross-domain gesture recognition and user identification using commodity WiFi in a real-time manner. The basic idea of WiHF is to derive a domain-independent motion change pattern of arm gestures from WiFi signals, rendering the unique gesture characteristics and the personalized user performing styles. To extract the motion change pattern in real time, we develop an efficient method based on the seam carving algorithm. Moreover, taking as input the motion change pattern, a deep neural network (DNN) is adopted for both gesture recognition and user identification tasks. In DNN, we apply splitting and splicing schemes to optimize collaborative learning for dual tasks. We implement WiHF and extensively evaluate its performance on a public dataset including 6 users and 6 gestures performed across 5 locations and 5 orientations in 3 environments. Experimental results show that WiHF achieves 97.65 and 96.74 percent for in-domain gesture recognition and user identification accuracy, respectively. The cross-domain gesture recognition accuracy is comparable with the state-of-the-art method, but the processing time is reduced by 30×. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","channel state information; commodity WiFi, cross-domain sensing; Gesture recognition; user identification","Li C., Liu M., Cao Z.",Article,wihf gesture user recognition user identify gesture recognition fundamental step ubiquitous base sensing wihf simultaneously enable cross domain gesture recognition user identification commodity real time manner basic idea wihf derive domain independent motion change pattern arm gesture signal render unique gesture characteristic personalize user perform style extract motion change pattern real time develop efficient base seam carve algorithm take input motion change pattern deep neural dnn adopt gesture recognition user identification task dnn apply splitting splicing scheme optimize collaborative dual task implement wihf extensively evaluate public dataset include user gesture perform location orientation environment experimental result wihf achieve 97.65 96.74 percent domain gesture recognition user identification accuracy respectively cross domain gesture recognition accuracy comparable state art processing time reduce 30×. channel state information commodity cross domain sensing gesture recognition user identification
attention-based gait recognition and walking direction estimation in wi-fi networks,2022.0,2.0,"Most existing Wi-Fi-based gait recognition systems consider gait cycle detection as a critical process. However, the noise mixed in dynamic measurements obtained from commercial Wi-Fi devices makes it hard to detect gait cycles. Herein, we adopt the attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder-decoder and propose a cycle-independent human gait recognition and walking direction estimation system, termed AGait, in Wi-Fi networks. For capturing more human walking dynamics, two receivers together with one transmitter are deployed in different spatial layouts. The Channel State Information (CSI) from different receivers are first assembled and refined to form an integrated walking profile. Then, the RNN encoder reads and encodes the walking profile into primary feature vectors. Given a specific gait or direction sensing task, a corresponding and particular attention vector is computed by the decoder and is finally used to predict the target. The attention scheme motivates AGait to learn to adaptively align with different critical clips of CSI data for different tasks. We implement AGait on commercial Wi-Fi devices in three different indoor environments, and the experimental results demonstrate that AGait can achieve average $F_1$F1 scores of 97.32 to 89.77 percent for gait recognition from a group of 4 to 10 subjects and 97.41 percent for direction estimation from 8 walking directions. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",attention scheme; Gait recognition; recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder; Wi-Fi signals,"Xu Y., Yang W., Chen M., Chen S., Huang L.",Article,attention base gait recognition walk direction estimation exist base gait recognition system consider gait cycle detection critical process noise mix dynamic measurement obtain commercial device make hard detect gait cycle adopt attention base recurrent neural rnn encoder decoder cycle independent human gait recognition walk direction estimation term agait capture human walking dynamic receiver transmitter deploy different spatial layout channel state information csi different receiver assemble refine form integrated walking profile rnn encoder read encode walking profile primary feature vector give specific gait direction sense task corresponding particular attention vector compute decoder finally predict target attention scheme motivate agait adaptively align different critical clip csi different task implement agait commercial device different indoor environment experimental result demonstrate agait achieve average $ f_1$f1 score 97.32 89.77 percent gait recognition group subject 97.41 percent direction estimation walking direction attention scheme gait recognition recurrent neural rnn encoder decoder signal
environment-robust device-free human activity recognition with channel-state-information enhancement and one-shot learning,2022.0,2.0,"Deep Learning plays an increasingly important role in device-free WiFi Sensing for human activity recognition (HAR). Despite its strong potential, significant challenges exist and are associated with the fact that one may require a large amount of samples for training, and the trained network cannot be easily adapted to a new environment. To address these challenges, we develop a novel scheme using matching network with enhanced channel state information (MatNet-eCSI) to facilitate one-shot learning HAR. We propose a CSI correlation feature extraction (CCFE) method to improve and condense the activity-related information in input signals. It can also significantly reduce the computational complexity by decreasing the dimensions of input signals. We also propose novel training strategy which effectively utilizes the data set from the previously seen environments (PSE). In the least, the strategy can effectively realize human activity recognition using only one sample for each activity from the testing environment and the data set from one PSE. Numerous experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art HAR methods, achieving higher recognition accuracy and less training time. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","device free sensing,channel state information,human activity recognition; one-shot learning; WiFi","Shi Z., Zhang J.A., Xu R.Y., Cheng Q.",Article,environment robust device free human activity recognition channel state information enhancement shot deep play increasingly important role device free sense human activity recognition har despite strong potential significant challenge exist associate fact require large sample training train easily adapt new environment address challenge develop novel scheme matching enhanced channel state information matnet ecsi facilitate shot har csi correlation feature extraction ccfe improve condense activity relate information input signal significantly reduce computational complexity decrease dimension input signal novel training strategy effectively utilize set previously see environment pse strategy effectively realize human activity recognition sample activity testing environment set pse numerous experiment conduct result demonstrate propose scheme significantly outperform state art har method achieve high recognition accuracy training time device free sensing channel state information human activity recognition shot
intelligent electrical pattern recognition of appliances consumption for home energy management using high resolution measurement,2022.0,0.0,"For an efficient energy management by residential users, monitoring and control of connected household appliances is required.

This paper proposes a model for the recognition of energy consumption patterns in household appliances, based on the capture of electrical parameters in connected appliances, through Smart Socket with an Intrusive Load Monitoring approach. The data acquisition system corresponds to an-Internet of Things (IoT) platform that uses Automatic Meter Reading devices, connected to a IoT-gateway via Wi-Fi to send data to an application on the web. For the recognition of the patterns, machine learning techniques are used.

automatic data acquisition system for wi-fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning system,2022.0,0.0,"Indoor Positioning System (IPS) can be developed by using different wireless technologies with different positioning techniques. One of the popular areas of study is the Wi-Fi fingerprinting based IPS because it has high flexibility. However, the implementation of a fingerprint based IPS required obtaining a fingerprint database beforehand. Manually performing data acquisition to obtain a fingerprint database requires a signif-icant amount of time and workforce. Thus, this paper presented a method to perform data acquisition automatically by utilizing the tiled floor characteristic. Furthermore, the fingerprint database constructed was utilized to perform studies on the impact of fingerprint patterns and errors in the location tag of fingerprints on the positioning accuracy of neural networks. Studies show that neural network models presented smaller positioning errors when fingerprints used are with environmental reading formed by RSS from more Wi-Fi anchors. Studies also show that when the location tag of fingerprints used for neural network models training consists of errors, positioning accuracy when validated with fingerprints in the validation set (errorless) depends on the type of error. The location tag of fingerprints used for training suffering large mean errors will significantly impact validation positioning accuracy compared with large standard deviation errors. © 2022 ICIC International.",Fingerprint; Indoor Positioning System (IPS); Line of Sight (LOS); Non-Line of Sight (NLOS); Received Signal Strength (RSS); Tiled floor,"Chong A.-M.-S., Yeo B.-C., Lim W.-S.",Article,automatic acquisition fingerprint base indoor positioning indoor positioning ips develop different technology different positioning technique popular area fingerprint base ip high flexibility implementation fingerprint base ip require obtain fingerprint database manually perform acquisition obtain fingerprint database require signif icant time workforce present perform acquisition automatically utilize tile floor characteristic furthermore fingerprint database construct utilize perform study impact fingerprint pattern error location tag fingerprint positioning accuracy neural study neural model present small positioning error fingerprint environmental reading form rss anchor study location tag fingerprint neural model training consist error position accuracy validate fingerprint validation set errorless depend type error location tag fingerprint training suffer large mean error significantly impact validation positioning accuracy compare large standard deviation error icic international fingerprint indoor positioning ips line sight los non line sight nlo receive signal strength rss tile floor
csitime: privacy-preserving human activity recognition using wifi channel state information,2022.0,0.0,"Human activity recognition (HAR) is an important task in many applications such as smart homes, sports analysis, healthcare services, etc. Popular modalities for human activity recognition involving computer vision and inertial sensors are in the literature for solving HAR, however, they face serious limitations with respect to different illumination, background, clutter, obtrusiveness, and other factors. In recent years, WiFi channel state information (CSI) based activity recognition is gaining momentum due to its many advantages including easy deployability, and cost-effectiveness. This work proposes CSITime, a modified InceptionTime network architecture, a generic architecture for CSI-based human activity recognition. We perceive CSI activity recognition as a multi-variate time series problem. The methodology of CSITime is threefold. First, we pre-process CSI signals followed by data augmentation using two label-mixing strategies — mixup and cutmix to enhance the neural network's learning. Second, in the basic block of CSITime, features from multiple convolutional kernels are concatenated and passed through a self-attention layer followed by a fully connected layer with Mish activation. CSITime network consists of six such blocks followed by a global average pooling layer and a final fully connected layer for the final classification. Third, in the training of the neural network, instead of adopting general training procedures such as early stopping, we use one-cycle policy and cosine annealing to monitor the learning rate. The proposed model has been tested on publicly available benchmark datasets, i.e., ARIL, StanWiFi, and SignFi datasets. The proposed CSITime has achieved accuracy of 98.20%, 98%, and 95.42% on ARIL, StanWiFi, and SignFi datasets, respectively, for WiFi-based activity recognition. This is an improvement on state-of-the-art accuracies by 3.3%, 0.67%, and 0.82% on ARIL, StanWiFi, and SignFi datasets, respectively.

algorithms for addressing line-of-sight issues in mmwave wifi networks using access point mobility,2022.0,0.0,"Line-of-sight (LOS) is a critical requirement for mmWave wireless communications. In this work, we explore the use of access point (AP) infrastructure mobility to optimize indoor mmWave WiFi network performance based on the discovery of LOS connectivity to stations (STAs). We consider a ceiling-mounted mobile (CMM) AP as the infrastructure mobility framework. Within this framework, we propose two heuristic algorithms (basic and weighted) derived from Hamming distance computation and a machine learning (ML) solution fully exploiting available network state information to address the LOS discovery problem. Based on the ML solution, we then propose a systematic solution WiMove, which can decide if and where the AP should move to for optimizing network performance.

intelligent positioning system: learning indoor mobility behavior and batch affiliations,2022.0,1.0,"Mobility data is of great significance because of the recurring events in daily behavior. These events are consistent and have a hidden structure. Identifying the hidden structures in such data can enhance indoor location predictability and provide interesting features. In this study, we present a methodology to predict and analyze the human mobility routines in indoor environments. We consider a structured indoor environment (i.e., university campuses) and generate an indoor Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) dataset. Based on this Wi-Fi RSS dataset, we synthesized the location information pertaining to 400 students from 10 batches. Afterward, we used the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to localize each student in the dataset. Then, we build the students’ mobility data by considering three indoor locations: the lecture room, laboratory, and cafeteria. We represented the repeated structure in the students’ mobility data by using the principal components analysis (PCA). PCA extracts the significant information from the dataset and represents this information by a set of new orthogonal vectors termed as principal components (PC). The first PC explains the largest portion of the dataset. In this context, the top four PC’s is used to describe the characteristics of the entire indoor mobility space and named as eigenlocations. This study provides three main contributions. First, we approximate the student mobility behavior over a day by using the weighted sum of the students’ primary eigenlocations. Second, we show how eigenlocation scheme perform in terms of inferring the student affiliations and estimating the friendship. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of proposed eigenlocation method for the synthetic indoor localization data by considering arbitrary levels of localization errors that are resulted from the used indoor positioning systems. Using the proposed eigenlocation scheme, we were able to reconstruct and predict the students’ locations over a specific day with an accuracy of 84%.

multiclass permanent magnets superstructure for indoor localization using artificial intelligence,2022.0,0.0,"Smartphones have become a popular tool for indoor localization and position estimation of users. Existing solutions mainly employ Wi-Fi, radio-frequency identification (RFID), and magnetic sensing techniques to track movements in crowded venues. These are highly sensitive to magnetic clutters and depend on local ambient magnetic fields, which frequently degrade their performance. Also, these techniques often require pre-known mapping surveys of the area, or the presence of active beacons, which are not always available. We embed small-volume and large-moment magnets in pre-known locations and arrange them in specific geometric constellations that create magnetic superstructure patterns of supervised magnetic signatures. These signatures constitute an unambiguous magnetic environment with respect to the moving sensor carrier. The localization algorithm learns the unique patterns of the scattered magnets during training and detects them from the ongoing streaming of data during localization. Our contribution is twofold. First, we deploy passive permanent magnets that do not require a power supply, in contrast to active magnetic transmitters.

a hierarchical lstm-based indoor geomagnetic localization algorithm,2022.0,0.0,"The traditional wireless signals used for positioning, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, are not stable enough for accurate indoor positioning due to the wireless signal multipath and time-varying effect. Compared with the wireless signals, the geomagnetic field signals inside buildings are influenced by ferromagnetic materials, which are significantly more stable for accurate indoor positioning. However, due to the location ambiguity problem, different positions may have similar geomagnetic readings, leading to significant positioning errors. Existing indoor geomagnetic positioning methods generally rely on single or short-sequence geomagnetic observations, which makes it difficult to discriminate between positions with similar geomagnetic values. Besides, geomagnetic anomalies can provide accurate position estimation within small-scale areas, but they cannot be utilized for large-scale localization due to the extensive existence of contour points and their rarity of remarkable geomagnetic anomalies. Therefore, we presents a geomagnetic indoor positioning algorithm based on two-level hierarchical LSTM (HLSTM) neural networks, which significantly increases the positioning accuracy by incorporating more historical geomagnetic observations. Based on the finding that geomagnetic signals are much stable, we adopt a sequence augmentation approach to generate a large number of geomagnetic trajectories for model training and testing instead of labor-extensive human collection. The HLSTM model is trained by the Pytorch framework with Cuda and cuDNN for parallel. Our proposed algorithm can obtain around 0.8m error of 67% probability on the self-collected ICT dataset and public MagPIE dataset. The results of the comparison experiment demonstrate that our proposed algorithm performs better accuracy and robustness when compared with other algorithms. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",data augmentation; hierarchical LSTM network; indoor geomagnetic positioning; Location-based service,"Wang L., Luo H., Wang Q., Shao W., Zhao F.",Article,hierarchical lstm base indoor geomagnetic localization algorithm traditional signal positioning bluetooth stable accurate indoor positioning signal multipath time vary effect compare signal geomagnetic field signal inside building influence ferromagnetic material significantly stable accurate indoor positioning location ambiguity problem different position similar geomagnetic reading lead significant positioning error exist indoor geomagnetic positioning method generally rely single short sequence geomagnetic observation make difficult discriminate position similar geomagnetic value geomagnetic anomaly provide accurate position estimation small scale area utilize large scale localization extensive existence contour point rarity remarkable geomagnetic anomaly present geomagnetic indoor positioning algorithm base level hierarchical lstm hlstm neural significantly increase positioning accuracy incorporate historical geomagnetic observation base finding geomagnetic signal stable adopt sequence augmentation approach generate large number geomagnetic trajectory model training testing instead labor extensive human collection hlstm model train pytorch framework cuda cudnn parallel propose algorithm obtain 0.8 m error probability self collect ict dataset public magpie dataset result comparison experiment demonstrate propose algorithm perform well accuracy robustness compare algorithm augmentation hierarchical lstm indoor geomagnetic positioning location base service
application of mobile edge computing combined with convolutional neural network deep learning in image analysis,2022.0,0.0,"This paper aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of image aesthetic classification in environmental art design and provide a more professional and convenient method. Based on the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) Deep Learning (DL) algorithm, the current situation and shortcomings of the existing image aesthetic classification are analyzed. Thereupon, the MEC technology is combined with CNN, and the MEC-based Image Recognition (IR) architecture and parallel Deep CNN-based aesthetic evaluation method are proposed. Then, the environmental art design images are analyzed and classified using the proposed method. Experiments are designed to verify the performance of the proposed methods. The results show that the average Response Time (RT) of different images recognition under the mobile cellular network and WiFi network is more than 2000 ms and less than 1000 ms, respectively. Comparison of the transmission speeds given different images indicates that the IR RT under the proposed MEC Hierarchical Discriminant Analysis (MECHDA) architecture is faster than the other three: the MECHDA architecture occupies a smaller bandwidth, with a constant 1kB image transmission traffic. Additionally, the aesthetic classification accuracy of the proposed model in A large-scale database for aesthetic visual analysis data set has reached 85.3%. In the data set of the CUHK Photo Quality Dataset (CUNK-PQ), the accuracy of aesthetic classification has reached 93%.

toward in-flight wi-fi: a neuro-fuzzy based routing approach for civil aeronautical ad hoc network,2022.0,0.0,"In-Flight Wi-Fi connectivity (IFC) paves way for supporting the Internet of Things over the clouds by connecting things inside a moving aircraft to the ground. Aeronautical Ad hoc Networks (AANET) is a new breed of Mobile Ad hoc networks envisioned to experience IFC over remote or oceanic regions. Due to the challenging characteristics of AANET such as limited bandwidth, intermittent connectivity, dynamic topologies, the greater velocity of aircraft, and variable geographical network sizes, it is very hard to design a realistic mobility model and network routing with remarkable Quality of Service (QoS) and requires immediate research solution. As the complexity of provisioning QoS network services significantly relies on the routing layer, this work aims at providing intelligent, reliable, and efficient data delivery with ensured QoS. In the aim of attaining a solution for QoS routing, this paper presents twofold design strategies. Firstly, the mobility of moving aircraft is modeled with International Civil Aviation Organization separations standards to avoid collisions among moving aircrafts, second is, a novel hybrid approach combining deep learning and fuzzy logic is proposed to deal with highly dynamic nature and growing air traffic. The neighbor discovery phase of existing routing protocols incurs more packet overhead and delay because of the traditional beaconing method, which is overcome in this work by using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast as it is kept on broadcasting the neighbor’s information in the cockpit display of every aircraft. To avoid the overwhelming of nodes, this work uses queuing delay of the neighbors to identify the node’s ability for packet transmission fairly distributes the load among aircrafts. The simulation results show that the proposed work provides notable improvements in packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and traffic overhead compared to the existing routing protocols in sparse and dense network scenarios. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Aeronautical Ad hoc Networks; Automatic dependent service – broadcast; Deep neural networks; Internet of Things; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Quality of Service,"Gurumekala T., Indira Gandhi S.",Article,flight neuro fuzzy base routing approach civil aeronautical ad hoc flight connectivity ifc pave way support internet thing cloud connect thing inside move aircraft ground aeronautical ad hoc aanet new breed mobile ad hoc envision experience ifc remote oceanic region challenging characteristic aanet limited bandwidth intermittent connectivity dynamic topology great velocity aircraft variable geographical size hard design realistic mobility model route remarkable quality service qos require immediate solution complexity provision qos service significantly rely route layer work aim provide intelligent reliable efficient delivery ensure qos aim attain solution qos routing present twofold design strategy firstly mobility move aircraft model international civil aviation organization separation standard avoid collision move aircraft second novel hybrid approach combine deep fuzzy logic propose deal highly dynamic nature grow air traffic neighbor discovery phase exist routing protocol incur packet overhead delay traditional beaconing overcome work automatic dependent surveillance broadcast keep broadcast neighbor information cockpit display aircraft avoid overwhelming node work use queue delay neighbor identify node ability packet transmission fairly distribute load aircraft simulation result propose work provide notable improvement packet delivery ratio end end delay traffic overhead compare exist routing protocol sparse dense scenario author(s exclusive licence springer verlag gmbh germany springer nature aeronautical ad hoc automatic dependent service broadcast deep neural internet thing neuro fuzzy inference system quality service
a survey on ubiquitous wifi-based indoor localization system for smartphone users from implementation perspectives,2022.0,0.0,"Indoor localization has the capability to change the way of providing location-based services in a closed environment and has more potential than that of GPS if the present shortcomings can be overcome. Thus, developing a ubiquitous Indoor Localization System (ILS) is the need of the day. WiFi-based indoor localization using smartphones is a promising approach to achieve ubiquity since smartphones are widely available today and most of the buildings are WiFi enabled. However, the significant variation of WiFi signal strengths with ambient conditions as well as device configuration badly affects the localization accuracy. Hence, a ubiquitous ILS, which would be widely available and would not require any specialized hardware support is still out of reach. Thus, this paper surveys state-of-the-art WiFi-based indoor localization techniques with a critical analysis of their applicability as a ubiquitous system. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to highlight the key research challenges of implementing a WiFi-based ILS when system ubiquity is the prime concern with a discussion on future direction.

an indoor wi-fi localization algorithm using ranging model constructed with transformed rssi and bp neural network,2022.0,0.0,"This paper focuses on improving indoor Wi-Fi localization by mitigating the effect of fluctuation of received signal strength indication (RSSI). The RSSI data collected at each reference point is first transformed through translation and scaling. The BP (Back Propagation) neural network is then used to construct the ranging model using the transformed RSSI to determine the distances between the target point and each reference point. A genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to optimize the initial values of weights and biases of the BP neural network. For convenience, our proposed ranging model is denoted as GTBPD. A new localization algorithm is then proposed, which uses the GTBPD model and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP, an iterative nonlinear optimization algorithm), and the algorithm is denoted as GTBPD-LSQP for simplicity. Experiments were conducted in three areas of two different teaching buildings with complex environments. The performance of the proposed GTBPD-LSQP algorithm is evaluated and compared with four existing algorithms.

performance comparison of machine learning algorithms in symbol detection using ofdm,2022.0,0.0,"Nowadays, vast amounts of data transmission and data retrieval are crucial and are done using many ways. Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is one of the efficient ways to transmit data with the help of orthogonal sub-carriers, which is used in applications such as WiFi, WiMax, and cellular communication. In this paper, instead of conventional detection techniques, machine learning (ML)-based methods are adopted to detect the symbols after data is being received through the Additive White Gaussian channel (AWGN). Detection is one of the areas in which the bit error rate (BER) performance of the OFDM system can be improved. Machine learning algorithms only depend on the training data to predict the outputs; hence, we can detect the symbol even without the use of cyclic prefix or channel estimation which can save a lot of time and data if the input data is large. A comparative study on the performance of receivers based on K-means clustering, k-nearest neighbors classifier, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis is done. The modulation techniques such as BPSK and QAM with various modulation orders ranging from 4 to 64 are used in this analysis.

a sensor-free crowd counting framework for indoor environments based on channel state information,2022.0,0.0,"The number of people in a specific region can provide valuable information in many aspects including Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems adjustment, firefighting rescue, consumer service updating and personnel management, etc. Most of the traditional studies for people counting utilize all the collected data for analyzing, which results in the heavy burden of data processing and extra sensing devices. In this paper, we propose a CSI-based sensor-free crowd counting scheme utilizing only existing WiFi infrastructure in a non-intrusive, low-cost and precise manner. Different from other systems, the best performed data in the received end are chosen to be analyzed for the purpose of obtaining the optimal results. The framework is proposed based on an intuition that different numbers of people wandering in the environment cause distinct impacts on WiFi signals. To begin with, the best performed data are processed and denoised with a wavelet-based denoising algorithm. Then, four features that can depict the relationship between the number of people and data fluctuation are extracted and analyzed. Eventually, the selected features are labeled and taken as inputs of several machine learning algorithms. And the complicated people counting problem is transformed into a classifying issue through extracting and training the features. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed easy and low-cost crowd counting framework.

behavior privacy preserving in rf sensing,2022.0,0.0,"Recent years have witnessed the booming development of RF sensing, which supports both identity authentication and behavior recognition by analysing the signal distortion caused by human body. In particular, RF-based identity authentication is more attractive to researchers, because it can capture the unique biological characteristics of users. However, the openness of wireless transmission raises privacy concerns since human behaviors could expose massive private information of users, which impedes the real-world implementation of RF-based user authentication applications. It is difficult to filter out the behavior information from the collected RF signals. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving deep neural network named BPCloak to erase the behavior information in RF signals while retaining the ability of user authentication. We conduct extensive experiments over mainstream RF signals collected from three real wireless systems, including the WiFi, radio frequency identification (RFID), and millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. The experimental results show that BPCloak significantly reduces the behavior recognition accuracy, i.e., 85%+, 75%+, and 65%+ reduction for WiFi, RFID, and mmWave systems respectively, merely with a slight penalty of accuracy decrease when using these three systems for user authentication, i.e., 1%-, 3%-, and 5%-, respectively.

twcc: a robust through-the-wall crowd counting system using ambient wifi signals,2022.0,0.0,"With the widespread of commercial communication equipment, WiFi signals are ubiquitous in human life. Therefore, utilizing WiFi signals to implement intelligent sensing applications is an inevitable trend. In WiFi sensing applications, through-the-wall crowd counting is a challenging problem. In the through-the-wall scenario, the wireless signal transmitted through the wall will carry a lot of noises and is severely attenuated. Therefore, the influence of human activities on the wireless signal is difficult to extract. To solve this problem, we propose TWCC, a through-the-wall crowd counting system using ambient WiFi signals. TWCC utilizes commercial WiFi equipments to extract the phase difference data of the channel state information (CSI) and transform it to sense the environment. First, TWCC preprocesses the data to remove uncorrelated noise, and then combines the subcarrier correlation to achieve through-the-wall human detection. When people exist, TWCC extracts features from four domains as feature groups, namely time domain, subcarrier domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain. Then TWCC uses different backpropagation (BP) neural networks for the features of the four domains and combines with weighting and threshold judgment to realize the through-the-wall crowd counting detection. Extensive real-world experiments show that TWCC achieves an average recognition accuracy of about 90% and maintains strong robustness to different speeds and environments.

sensor-aided learning for wi-fi positioning with beacon channel state information,2022.0,0.0,"Because each indoor site has its own radio propagation characteristics, a site survey process is essential to optimize a Wi-Fi ranging strategy for range-based positioning solutions. This study examines an unsupervised learning technique that autonomously learns an optimal ranging strategy for each site using Wi-Fi and sensor data accumulated while users access a positioning application. Using the collected sensor data, the device trajectory is regenerated, and a Wi-Fi ranging module is optimized to generate the shape of the estimated trajectory using Wi-Fi, similar to that obtained from sensors. In this process, the ranging module learns the way to identify the channel conditions from each Wi-Fi access point (AP) and produces ranging results accordingly. Furthermore, we collect the channel state information (CSI) from beacon frames to investigate the benefit of using CSI in addition to received signal strength measurements. With the CSI, the ranging module can identify diverse channel conditions from each AP and more accurately generate the reliability of each distance estimate to achieve accurate positioning results. The effectiveness of the proposed learning technique is verified using a real-time positioning application implemented on a PC platform [1].

reservoir computing meets extreme learning machine in real-time mimo-ofdm receive processing,2022.0,0.0,"In this paper, we consider a real-time deep learning-based symbol detection approach for MIMO-OFDM systems. To exploit the temporal correlation of the wireless channel and the time-frequency structure of OFDM signals, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with deep feedforward output layers is introduced, where the recurrent layers and feedforward output layers are designed to process time-domain and frequency-domain information respectively. Reservoir computing (RC), a special type of RNN, and extreme learning machine (ELM), a special type of feedforward neural network, are chosen as the corresponding building blocks to facilitate over-the-air training. An online training loss objective is introduced to recursively update the neural weights in real-time. We believe this is the first work in the literature to realize real-time machine learning for MIMO-OFDM symbol detection, i.e., conducting NN-based symbol detection on an OFDM symbol basis. We demonstrate that (1) the IEEE standardized WiFi training sequence can be directly applied as the real-time training sequence (2) the symbol detection performance can be further improved by using our theoretically derived pilot pattern.

dbscan and td integrated wi-fi positioning algorithm,2022.0,0.0,"A density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and three distances (TD) integrated Wi-Fi positioning algorithm was proposed, aiming to enhance the positioning accuracy and stability of fingerprinting by the dynamic selection of signal-domain distance to obtain reliable nearest reference points (RPs). Two stages were included in this algorithm. One was the offline stage, where the offline fingerprint database was constructed and the other was the online positioning stage. Three distances (Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and cosine distance), DBSCAN, and high-resolution distance selection principle were combined to obtain more reliable nearest RPs and optimal signal-domain distance in the online stage. Fused distance, the fusion of position-domain and signal-domain distances, was applied for DBSCAN to generate the clustering results, considering both the spatial structure and signal strength of RPs. Based on the principle that the higher resolution the distance, the more clusters will be obtained, the high-resolution distance was used to compute positioning results. The weighted K-nearest neighbor (WKNN) considering signal-domain distance selection was used to estimate positions. Two scenarios were selected as test areas; a complex-layout room (Scenario A) for post-graduates and a typical large indoor environment (Scenario B) covering 3200 m2 . In both Scenarios A and B, compared with support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and rank algorithms, the improvement rates of positioning accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithm were up to 60.44 and 60.93%, respectively.

deep learning-based wireless signal classification in the iot environment,2022.0,0.0,"With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), diverse wireless devices are increasing rapidly. Those devices have different wireless interfaces that generate incompatible wireless signals. Each signal has its own physical characteristics with signal modulation and demodulation scheme. When there exist different wireless devices, they can suffer from severe Cross-Technology Interferences (CTI). To reduce the communication overhead due to the CTI in the real IoT environment, a central coordinator can be able to detect and identify wireless signals existing in the same communication areas. This paper investigates how to classify various radio signals using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and attention mechanism. CNN can reduce the amount of computation by reducing weights by using convolution, and LSTM belonging to RNN models can alleviate the long-term dependence problem. Furthermore, attention mechanism can reduce the short-term memory problem of RNNs by reexamining the data output from the decoder and the entire data entered into the encoder at every point in time. To accurately classify radio signals according to their weights, we design a model based on CNN, LSTM, and attention mechanism. As a result, we propose a model CLARINet that can classify original data by minimizing the loss and detects changes in sequences. In a case of the real IoT environment with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee devices, we can normally obtain wireless signals from 10 to 20 dB. The accuracy of CLARINet's radio signal classification with CNN-LSTM and attention mechanism can be seen that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exhibits high accuracy at 16 dB to about 92.03%. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

fall detection system with artificial intelligence-based edge computing,2022.0,0.0,"Falls are the second leading cause of death from unintentional injuries in older adults. Although many systems have been used to detect falls, they are limited by the computational complexity of the algorithm. The images taken by the camera must be transmitted through a network to the back-end server for calculation. As the demand for Internet of Things increases, this architecture faces such problems as high bandwidth costs and server computing overload. Emerging methods reduce the workload of servers by transferring certain computing tasks from cloud servers to edge computing platforms. To this end, this study developed a fall detection system based on neuromorphic computing hardware, which streamlines and transplants the neural network model of the back-end computer to the edge computing platform. Through the neural network model with integer 8 bit precision deployed on the edge computing platform, the object photos obtained by the camera are converted into human motion features, and a support vector machine is then used for classification. After experimental evaluation, an accuracy of 96% was reached, the detection speed of the overall system was 11.5 frames per second, and the power consumption was 0.3 W. This system can monitor the fall events of older adults in real time and over a long period. All data were calculated on the edge computing platform. The system only reports fall events via Wi-Fi, thereby protecting the privacy of the user. © 2021 IEEE.",Deep learning; edge computing; fall detection; neuromorphic computing hardware; the IoT,"Lin B.-S., Yu T., Peng C.-W., Lin C.-H., Hsu H.-K., Lee I.-J., Zhang Z.",Article,fall detection artificial intelligence base edge computing fall second lead cause death unintentional injury old adult system detect fall limit computational complexity algorithm image take camera transmit end server calculation demand internet thing increase architecture face problem high bandwidth cost server computing overload emerge method reduce workload server transfer certain computing task cloud server edge computing platform end develop fall detection base neuromorphic computing hardware streamline transplant neural model end computer edge computing platform neural model integer bit precision deploy edge computing platform object photo obtain camera convert human motion feature support vector machine classification experimental evaluation accuracy reach detection speed overall 11.5 frame second power consumption 0.3 w. monitor fall event old adult real time long period calculate edge computing platform report fall event protect privacy user deep edge computing fall detection neuromorphic computing hardware iot
escifi: an energy saving mechanism for wlans based on machine learning,2022.0,0.0,"As wireless local area networks grow in size to provide access to users, power consumption becomes an important issue. Power savings in a large-scale Wi-Fi network, with low impact to user service, is undoubtedly desired. In this work, we propose and evaluate the eSCIFI energy saving mechanism for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). eSCIFI is an energy saving mechanism that uses machine learning algorithms as occupancy demand estimators. The eSCIFI mechanism is designed to cope with a broader range of WLANs, which includes Wi-Fi networks such as the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) SCIFI network. The eSCIFI can cope with WLANs that cannot acquire data in a real time manner and/or possess a limited CPU power. The eSCIFI design also includes two clustering algorithms, named cSCIFI and cSCIFI+, that help to guarantee the network’s coverage. eSCIFI uses those network clusters and machine learning predictions as input features to an energy state decision algorithm that then decides which Access Points (AP) can be switched off during the day. To evaluate eSCIFI performance, we conducted several trace-driven simulations comparing the eSCIFI mechanism using both clustering algorithms with other energy saving mechanisms found in the literature using the UFF SCIFI network traces. The results showed that eSCIFI mechanism using the cSCIFI+ clustering algorithm achieves the best performance and that it can save up to 64.32% of the UFF SCIFI network energy without affecting the user coverage. © 2022 by the authors.

smart drone controller framework—toward an internet of drones,2022.0,0.0,"There has been an increasing trend to use multiple drones to cooperate autonomously beyond visual line-of-sight missions such as remote services, digital governance and planning, control of safety and security in a smart nation/smart city. In addition, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a key enabler to achieve efficiency in missions such as object detection and intruder detection. In this context, most of the commercially off-the-shelf Wi-Fi drones have limited resources and do not offer any firmware customization; these inherent limitations and technical gaps highlight the need for a software-based smart controller framework to realize support for a team of autonomous drones working together as an Internet of Drones (IoD). This can form the basis for strategic management of new Smart Cities that aim to optimize resources utilization and autonomize services. In this chapter, we present a preliminary architectural design to support needed capabilities and features of a cross-platform Smart Drone Controller (SDC) framework. An SDC framework supports a deployed team of Wi-Fi-based drones to conduct assigned missions collaboratively. The SDC’s ML engine has an option to choose algorithms according to the assigned mission. Overall, our SDC framework prototype improves the reliability of the team-based mission and enables a mixed selection of commercial drones to be deployed remotely and collaboratively as an IoD to create positive impact in service autonomy offered to smart city residents.

utilizing deep learning models in csi-based human activity recognition,2022.0,0.0,"In recent years, channel state information (CSI) in WiFi 802.11n has been increasingly used to collect data pertaining to human activity. Such raw data are then used to enhance human activity recognition. Activities such as lying down, falling, walking, running, sitting down, and standing up can now be detected with the use of information collected through CSI. Human activity recognition has a multitude of applications, such as home monitoring of patients. Four deep learning models are presented in this paper, namely: a convolution neural network (CNN) with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU); a CNN with a GRU and attention; a CNN with a GRU and a second CNN, and a CNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a second CNN. Those models were trained to perform Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using CSI amplitude data collected by a CSI tool. Experiments conducted to test the efficacy of these models showed superior results compared with other recent approaches. This enhanced performance of our models may be attributable the ability of our models to make full use of available data and to extract all data features, including high dimensionality and time sequence. The highest average recognition accuracy reached by the proposed models was achieved by the CNN-GRU, and the CNN-GRU with attention models, standing at 99.31% and 99.16%, respectively. In addition, the performance of the models was evaluated for unseen CSI data by training our models using a random split-of-dataset method (70% training and 30% testing). Our models achieved impressive results with accuracies reaching 100% for nearly all activities. For the lying down activity, accuracy obtained from the CNN-GRU model stood at 99.46%; slightly higher than the 99.05% achieved by the CNN-GRU with attention model. This confirmed the robustness of our models against environmental changes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Channel state information; Convolution neural network; Gated recurrent unit; Human activity recognition,"Shalaby E., ElShennawy N., Sarhan A.",Article,utilize deep model csi base human activity recognition recent year channel state information csi 802.11n increasingly collect pertain human activity raw enhance human activity recognition activity lie fall walk run sit stand detect use information collect csi human activity recognition multitude application home monitoring patient deep model present convolution neural cnn gate recurrent unit gru cnn gru attention cnn gru second cnn cnn long short term memory lstm second cnn model train perform human activity recognition har csi amplitude collect csi tool experiment conduct test efficacy model show superior result compare recent approach enhanced model attributable ability model use available extract feature include high dimensionality time sequence high average recognition accuracy reach propose model achieve cnn gru cnn gru attention model stand 99.31 99.16 respectively addition model evaluate unseen csi train model random split dataset training testing model achieve impressive result accuracy reach nearly activity lie activity accuracy obtain cnn gru model stand 99.46 slightly high 99.05 achieve cnn gru attention model confirm robustness model environmental change author(s exclusive licence springer verlag london ltd springer nature channel state information convolution neural gate recurrent unit human activity recognition
a machine-learning framework to improve wi-fi based indoorpositioning,2022.0,0.0,"The indoor positioning system comprises portable wireless devices that aid in finding the location of people or objects within the buildings. Identification of the items is through the capacity level of the signal received from various access points (i.e., Wi-Fi routers). The positioning of the devices utilizing some algorithms has drawn more attention from the researchers. Yet, the designed algorithm still has problems for accurate floor planning. So, the accuracy of position estimation with minimum error is made possible by introducing Gaussian Distributive Feature Embedding based Deep Recurrent Perceptive Neural Learning (GDFE-DRPNL), a novel framework. Novel features from the dataset are through two processing stages dimensionality reduction and position estimation. Initially, the essential elements selection using the Gaussian Distributive Feature Embedding technique is the novel framework. The feature reduction process aims to reduce the time consumption and overhead for estimating the location of various devices. In the next stage, employ Deep Recurrent multilayer Perceptive Neural Learning to evaluate the device position with dimensionality reduced features. The proposed Deep-learning approach accurately learns the quality and the signal strength data with multiple layers by applying Deming Regressive Trilateral Positioning Model. As a result, the GDFE-DRPNL framework increases the positioning accuracy and minimizes the error rate. The experimental assessments with various factors such as positioning accuracy minimized by 70% and 60%, com-putation time minimized by 45% and 55% as well as overhead by 11% and 23% compared with PFRL and two-dimensional localization algorithm.

an agile ai and iot-augmented smart farming: a cost-effective cognitive weather station,2022.0,0.0,"Internet of Things (IoT) can be seen as the electricity of 21st century. It has been reshaping human life daily during the last decade, with various applications in several critical domains such as agriculture. Smart farming is a real-world application in which Internet of Things (IoT) technologies like agro-weather stations can have a direct impact on humans by enhancing crop quality, supporting sustainable agriculture, and eventually generating steady growth. Meanwhile, most agro-weather solutions are neither customized nor affordable for small farmers within developing countries. Furthermore, due to the outdoor challenges, it is often a challenge to develop and deploy low-cost yet robust systems. Robustness, which is determined by several factors, including energy consumption, portability, interoperability, and system’s ease of use. In this paper, we present an agile AI-Powered IoT-based low-cost platform for cognitive monitoring for smart farming. The hybrid Multi-Agent and the fully containerized system continuously surveys multiple agriculture parameters such as temperature, humidity, and pressure to provide end-users with real-time environmental data and AI-based forecasts. The surveyed data is ensured through several heterogeneous nodes deployed within the base station and in the open sensing area. The collected data is transmitted to the local server for pre-processing and the cloud server for backup. The system backbone communication is based on heterogeneous protocols such as MQTT, NRF24L01, and WiFi for radio communication. We also set up a user-friendly web-based graphical user interface (GUI) to support different user profiles.

steering a robotic wheelchair based on voice recognition system using convolutional neural networks,2022.0,0.0,"Many wheelchair people depend on others to control the movement of their wheelchairs, which significantly influences their independence and quality of life. Smart wheelchairs offer a degree of self‐dependence and freedom to drive their own vehicles. In this work, we designed and implemented a low‐cost software and hardware method to steer a robotic wheelchair. Moreover, from our method, we developed our own Android mobile app based on Flutter software. A convolutional neural network (CNN)‐based network‐in‐network (NIN) structure approach integrated with a voice recognition model was also developed and configured to build the mobile app. The technique was also implemented and configured using an offline Wi‐Fi network hotspot between software and hardware components. Five voice commands (yes, no, left, right, and stop) guided and controlled the wheelchair through the Raspberry Pi and DC motor drives. The overall system was evaluated based on a trained and validated English speech corpus by Arabic native speakers for isolated words to assess the performance of the Android OS application. The maneuverability performance of indoor and outdoor navigation was also evaluated in terms of accuracy. The results indicated a degree of accuracy of approximately 87.2% of the accurate prediction of some of the five voice commands. Additionally, in the real‐time performance test, the root‐mean‐square deviation (RMSD) values between the planned and actual nodes for indoor/outdoor maneuvering were 1.721 × 10−5 and 1.743 × 10−5, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.

wipg: contactless action recognition using ambient wi‐fi signals,2022.0,0.0,"Motion recognition has a wide range of applications at present. Recently, motion recognition by analyzing the channel state information (CSI) in Wi‐Fi packets has been favored by more and more scholars. Because CSI collected in the wireless signal environment of human activity usually carries a large amount of human‐related information, the motion‐recognition model trained for a specific person usually does not work well in predicting another person’s motion. To deal with the difference, we propose a personnel‐independent action‐recognition model called WiPg, which is built by convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN). Ac-cording to CSI data of 14 yoga movements of 10 experimenters with different body types, model training and testing were carried out, and the recognition results, independent of bod type, were obtained. The experimental results show that the average correct rate of WiPg can reach 92.7% for recognition of the 14 yoga poses, and WiPg realizes “cross‐personnel” movement recognition with excellent recognition performance. © 2022 by the authors.

improving the accuracy of estimates of indoor distance moved using deep learning-based movement status recognition,2022.0,0.0,"As a result of the development of wireless indoor positioning techniques such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and Ultra-wideband (UWB), the positioning traces of moving people or objects in indoor environments can be tracked and recorded, and the distances moved can be estimated from these data traces. These estimates are very useful in many applications such as workload statistics and optimized job allocation in the field of logistics. However, due to the uncertainties of the wireless signal and corresponding positioning errors, accurately estimating movement distance still faces challenges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a movement status recognition-based distance estimating method to improve the accuracy. We divide the positioning traces into segments and use an encoder–decoder deep learning-based model to determine the motion status of each segment. Then, the distances of these segments are calculated by different distance estimating methods based on their movement statuses. The experiments on the real positioning traces demonstrate the proposed method can precisely identify the movement status and significantly improve the distance estimating accuracy. © 2022 by the authors.

diagnosis of covid-19 based on artificial intelligence models and physiological sensors: review,2022.0,0.0,"Covid-19 invaded the world very quickly and caused the loss of many lives; maximum emergency was activated all over the world due to its rapid spread. Consequently, it became a huge burden on emergency and intensive care units due to the large number of infected individuals and the inability of the medical staff to deal with patients according to the degree of severity. Covid-19 can be diagnosed based on the artificial intelligence (AI) model. Based on AI, the CT images of the patient's chest can be analyzed to identify the patient case whether it is normal or he/she has Covid-19. The possibility of employing physiological sensors such as heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, and SpO2 sensors in diagnosing Covid-19 was investigated. In this paper, several articles which used intelligent techniques and vital signs for diagnosing Covid-19 have been reviewed, classified, and compared. The combination of AI and physiological sensors reading, called AI-PSR, can help the clinician in making the decisions and predicting the occurrence of respiratory failure in Covid-19 patients. The physiological parameters of the Covid-19 patients can be transmitted wirelessly based on a specific wireless technology such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to the clinician to avoid direct contact between the patient and the clinician or nursing staff.

adaptive scheme for crowd counting using off-the-shelf wireless routers,2022.0,0.0,"Since the outbreak of the world-wide novel coronavirus pandemic, crowd counting in public areas, such as in shopping centers and in commercial streets, has gained popularity among public health administrations for preventing the crowds from gathering. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive method for crowd counting based on Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) by using common commercial wireless routers. Compared with previous researches on device-free crowd counting, our proposed method is more adaptive to the change of environment and can achieve high accuracy of crowd count estimation. Because the distance between access point (AP) and monitor point (MP) is typically non-fixed in real-world applications, the strength of received signals varies and makes the traditional amplitude-related models to perform poorly in different environments. In order to achieve adaptivity of the crowd count estimation model, we used convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to extract features from correlation coefficient matrix of subcarriers which are insensitive to the change of received signal strength. We conducted experiments in university classroom settings and our model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.79% in estimating a variable number of participants. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

using machine learning to estimate pedestrian and bicyclist count of intersection by bluetooth low energy,2022.0,0.0,"Quantifying pedestrian and bicycle traffic is important for planning, investment, and safety improvements. Traffic agencies have implemented various pedestrian/bicyclist detection systems, but the accuracy is unsatisfactory for intersections. Some studies have explored the use of media access control (MAC) address-scanning sensors such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scanners. However, they may suffer from low detection rates. To overcome these shortcomings, this study proposed a system based upon Bluetooth low energy (BLE) scanners. First, the feasibility was assessed by identifying the detection rate and range of BLE scanners. Evaluation experiments uncovered that the detection rate is much higher than the Bluetooth ordinary, and it is sufficiently high for traffic count studies. Moreover, the detection range could cover the whole intersection while reducing the overestimating caused by the large detection range in comparison with other MAC address-scanning sensors. A two-step framework is then proposed for identifying the pedestrians and bicyclists from stationary objects and motorized travelers using one of the popular machine-learning algorithms, one-class support vector machine. The proposed system is validated by the benchmark count data from video footage. The results show that the system can reasonably estimate the counts of pedestrians and bicyclists in a mixed-traffic environment. The average absolute percentage error is 6.35%. This study has concluded that compared to traditional Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, BLE is more suitable for estimating the counts of pedestrians and bicyclists. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Gong Y., Abdel-Aty M.",Article,machine estimate pedestrian bicyclist count intersection bluetooth low energy quantifying pedestrian bicycle traffic important planning investment safety improvement traffic agency implement pedestrian bicyclist detection system accuracy unsatisfactory intersection study explore use medium access control mac address scan sensor bluetooth scanner suffer low detection rate overcome shortcoming propose base bluetooth low energy ble scanner feasibility assess identify detection rate range ble scanner evaluation experiment uncover detection rate high bluetooth ordinary sufficiently high traffic count study detection range cover intersection reduce overestimating cause large detection range comparison mac address scan sensor step framework propose identify pedestrian bicyclist stationary object motorize traveler popular machine algorithm class support vector machine propose validate benchmark count video footage result reasonably estimate count pedestrian bicyclist mixed traffic environment average absolute percentage error 6.35 conclude compare traditional bluetooth ble suitable estimate count pedestrian bicyclist american society civil engineer
predicting resource availability in local mobile crowd computing using convolutional gru,2022.0,0.0,"In mobile crowd computing (MCC), people’s smart mobile devices (SMDs) are utilized as computing resources. Considering the ever-growing computing capabilities of today’s SMDs, a collection of them can offer significantly high-performance computing services. In a local MCC, the SMDs are typically connected to a local Wi-Fi network. Organizations and institutions can leverage the SMDs available within the campus to form local MCCs to cater to their computing needs without any financial and operational burden. Though it offers an economical and sustainable computing solution, users’ mobility poses a serious issue in the QoS of MCC. To address this, before submitting a job to an SMD, we suggest estimating that particular SMD’s availability in the network until the job is finished. For this, we propose a convolutional GRU-based prediction model to assess how long an SMD is likely to be available in the network from any given point of time. For experimental purposes, we collected real users’ mobility data (in-time and out-time) with respect to a Wi-Fi access point. To build the prediction model, we presented a novel feature extraction method to be applied to the time-series data.

novel intrusion detection system,2022.0,0.0,"Wireless networks are the foundation of modern communication. This also leads to network data hijacking and network attacks. Despite the fact that different databases and methods exist to combat this, the network intrusion problem is still on the rise. To address this, the proposed research work introduces a faster and better Intrusion Detection System trained on the AWID data-set with faster learning and better accuracy. A unique supervised studying device has been evolved to categorise the community wi-fi as malicious or benign.

smart prediction and monitoring of waste disposal system using iot and cloud for iot based smart cities,2022.0,0.0,"One of the prominent applications of Internet of Things (IoT) in this digital era is the development of smart cities. In IoT based smart cities, the smart objects (devices) are connected with each other via internet as a backbone. The sensed data by the smart objects are transmitted to the sink for further processing using multi hop communication. The smart cities use the analyzed data to improve their infrastructure, public utilities and they enhance their services by using the IoT technology for the betterment of livelihood of the common people. For IoT based smart cities, waste collection is a prominent issue for municipalities that aim to achieve a clean environment. With a boom in population in urban areas, an increasing amount of waste is generated. A major issue of waste management system is the poor process used in waste collection and segregation. Public bins begin to overflow for a long period before the process of cleaning starts, which is resulting in an accumulation of bacteria causing bad odors and spreading of diseases. In order to overcome this issue, in this paper an IoT based smart predication and monitoring of waste disposal system is proposed which utilizes off-the-shelf components that can be mounted to a bin of any size and measure fill levels. An Arduino microcontroller is employed in the proposed model to interface the infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), weight sensors, and a Global Positioning System (GPS) module is used to monitor the status of bins at predetermined intervals. The proposed system transmits the data using the cluster network to the master module which is connected to the backend via Wi-Fi. As data is collected, an intelligent neural network algorithm namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used which will intelligently learn and predict the upcoming wastage from waste generation patterns. Moreover, the proposed system uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to notify the appropriate people when the bins were full and needed to be emptied. The Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) JavaScript Application Programming Interface (API) is used to send notification messages in web apps in browsers that provide service work support. Hence, the proposed system is useful to the society by providing facilities to the governments for enforcing stricter regulations for waste disposal.

a lightweight deep learning algorithm for wifi-based identity recognition,2021.0,1.0,"WiFi-based identity recognition is predominant because of its noninvasive and ubiquitous advantages. However, existing approaches show slow training speed and limited applicability. In this article, we propose a lightweight deep learning model, named as lightweight WiFi-based identification (LW-WiID), to address these technical challenges. LW-WiID reconstructs original data of channel state information into frequency energy graph, which contains not only the temporal feature of the gait but also the spatial feature among subcarriers, ensuring the accuracy of identity recognition. Furthermore, a novel Balloon mechanism is designed to achieve the lightweight. Through information integration crossing both layers and channels, the Balloon mechanism effectively reduces the number of model parameters.

multimodal csi-based human activity recognition using gans,2021.0,2.0,"Channel state information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR) has received great attention in recent years due to its advantages in privacy protection, insensitivity to illumination, and no requirement for wearable devices. In this article, we propose a multimodal channel state information-based activity recognition (MCBAR) system that leverages existing WiFi infrastructures and monitors human activities from CSI measurements. MCBAR aims to address the performances degradation of WiFi-based human recognition systems due to environmental dynamics. Specifically, we address the issue of nonuniformly distributed unlabeled data with rarely performed activities by taking advantages of the generative adversarial network (GAN) and semisupervised learning. We apply a multimodal generator to approximate the CSI data distribution in different environment settings with limited measured CSI data. The generated CSI data using the multimodal generator can provide better diversity for knowledge transfer. This multimodal generator improves the ability of MCBAR to recognize specific activities with various CSI patterns caused by environmental dynamics. Compared to state-of-the-art CSI-based recognition systems, MCBAR is more robust as it is able to handle the nonuniformly distributed CSI data collected from a new environment setting. In addition, diverse generated data from the multimodal generator improves the stability of the system. We have tested MCBAR under multiple experimental settings at different places. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes environmental dynamics and outperforms existing HAR systems. © 2014 IEEE.",Channel state information (CSI); Convolutional neural network (CNN); Generative adversarial networks (GANs); Human behavior recognition; Transfer learning,"Wang D., Yang J., Cui W., Xie L., Sun S.",Article,multimodal csi base human activity recognition gans channel state information csi)-base human activity recognition har receive great attention recent year advantage privacy protection insensitivity illumination requirement wearable device article multimodal channel state information base activity recognition mcbar leverage exist infrastructure monitor human activity csi measurement mcbar aim address performance degradation base human recognition system environmental dynamic specifically address issue nonuniformly distribute unlabele rarely perform activity take advantage generative adversarial gan semisupervise apply multimodal generator approximate csi distribution different environment setting limited measure csi generate csi multimodal generator provide well diversity knowledge transfer multimodal generator improve ability mcbar recognize specific activity csi pattern cause environmental dynamic compare state art csi base recognition system mcbar robust able handle nonuniformly distribute csi collect new environment set addition diverse generate multimodal generator improve stability test mcbar multiple experimental setting different place experimental result demonstrate algorithm overcome environmental dynamics outperform exist har system channel state information csi convolutional neural cnn generative adversarial gan human behavior recognition transfer
a recognition and monitoring algorithm for drone remote control signals using residual neural network [采用残差神经网络的无人机遥控信号识别监测算法],2021.0,0.0,"An algorithm to monitor the control signal of drone using residual neural network is proposed to solve the problems that remote control signals of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are usually susceptible to random noise and narrowband or broadband interference, and it is difficult to extract the frequency hopping period and rate of frequency hopping sequence of a remote control signal. Firstly, a time-spectrogram is obtained via a sliding time window, and a threshold of signal spectrum detection is calculated by a joint adaptive method. Then, pre-processing operations such as binarization and interference elimination are performed on the time-spectrogram to construct the time spectrum to be measured. Turther, a large number of processed spectrograms of different control signals are used as a data set to train and test the deep residual neural network, so as to avoid the problem of difficult extraction of frequency hopping features. Finally, the trained network is used to recognize the current remote control signal and its model in real time. The proposed DRN-UVA algorithm overcomes the adverse effects such as occlusion and UVA size, and is an effective supplement to anti-UVA system based on radar or optics. Experimental results show that the DRN-UAV algorithm shortens the single recognition time to about 1/25 of the traditional reading method. At the same error detection rate, the signal spectrum detection threshold obtained by the DRN-UAV algorithm reduces by 1.4 dBm compared with that of the traditional method and the detection range is effectively increased on different hardware platforms. When the signal-to-noise ratio is higher than 5.5 dB, the detection error rate can reach less that 0.01% under the interferences of single narrowband fixed-frequency signal and WiFi. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

a deep learning-based indoor-positioning approach using received strength signal indication and carrying mode information,2021.0,1.0,"Indoor smartphone positioning is one of the key information and cummunication technology techniques enabling new opportunities for indoor navigation and mobile location-based services to enrich our everyday lives. Generally, the development of an indoor positioning system heavily relies on wireless sensor network. Since wireless sensors can estimate the probable distance between radio source and the sensors themselves by evaluating the strengths of wireless signals received from radio sources, such as received strength signal indications of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. However, the radio signals could be influenced by indoor and outdoor objects, such as walls and furniture, and carrying mode of a user's smartphone, like in-pocket or in-backpack. But, according to the best of our knowledge, up to present, people do not know how carrying mode information (CMI) influences the positioning accuracy of a positioning system. Therefore, in this study, we propose an indoor positioning scheme, named LEarning-based Indoor Positioning System (LEIPS), which identifies the carrying mode of a user's smartphone by using this smartphone's inertial sensors and deep learning algorithms, aiming to increase indoor positioning accuracy.

wi-fruit: see through fruits with smart devices,2021.0,0.0,"People usually assess fruit qualities from external features such as color, shape, size, and texture. However, it is quite common that we select fruits with perfect appearances but rotten inside, especially for fruits with thick pericarps. Thus the accurate measurement is desirable to evaluate the internal conditions of fruits. As two key features of fruit internal qualities, existing methods on measuring fruit moisture and soluble solid contents (SSC) are either destructive or costly, limiting their adoption in daily life. In this paper, we propose Wi-Fruit, a non-destructive and low-cost fruit moisture and SSC measurement system leveraging Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). First, to cope with the fruit structure dependency challenge, we propose a double-quotient model to pre-process CSI on adjacent antennas. Second, to address the fruit size and type dependency challenges, a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) model with visual information fusion is proposed for fruit moisture and SSC estimations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on 6 types of fruits with both thick (i.e., watermelon and grapefruit) and thin pericarps (i.e., dragon fruit, apple, pear, and orange) over a month in either an empty laboratory room or a library with massive books. Results demonstrate that Wi-Fruit achieves an acceptable estimation accuracy (RMSE=0.319). It is independent of various fruit structures, sizes, and types, while also robust to time and environmental changes. The fruit internal sensing capabilities of Wi-Fruit can help fruit saving and safety in both pre-harvest and post-harvest applications. © 2021 ACM.",ANN; CSI; Fruit Sensing; Image Processing; Moisture; Signal Processing; Soluble Solid Content; Wi-Fi,"Liu Y., Jiang L., Kong L., Xiang Q., Liu X., Chen G.",Article,fruit fruit smart device people usually assess fruit quality external feature color shape size texture common select fruit perfect appearance rotten inside especially fruit thick pericarp accurate measurement desirable evaluate internal condition fruit key feature fruit internal quality exist method measure fruit moisture soluble solid content ssc destructive costly limit adoption daily life fruit non destructive low cost fruit moisture ssc measurement leverage channel state information csi cope fruit structure dependency challenge double quotient model pre process csi adjacent antenna second address fruit size type dependency challenge lightweight artificial neural ann model visual information fusion propose fruit moisture ssc estimation extensive evaluation conduct type fruit thick i.e. watermelon grapefruit thin pericarp i.e. dragon fruit apple pear orange month laboratory room library massive book result demonstrate fruit achieve acceptable estimation accuracy rmse=0.319 independent fruit structure size type robust time environmental change fruit internal sensing capability fruit help fruit saving safety pre harvest post harvest application acm ann csi fruit sensing image processing moisture signal processing soluble solid content
adaptive computation offloading for mobile augmented reality,2021.0,0.0,"Augmented reality (AR) underpins many emerging mobile applications, but it increasingly requires more computation power for better machine understanding and user experience. While computation offloading promises a solution for high-quality and interactive mobile AR, existing methods work best for high-definition videos but cannot meet the real-time requirement for emerging 4K videos due to the long uploading latency. We introduce ACTOR, a novel computation-offloading framework for 4K mobile AR. To reduce the uploading latency, ACTOR dynamically and judiciously downscales the mobile video feed to be sent to the remote server. On the server-side, it leverages image super-resolution technology to scale back the received video so that high-quality object detection, tracking and rendering can be performed on the full 4K resolution. ACTOR employs machine learning to predict which of the downscaling resolutions and super-resolution configurations should be used, by taking into account the video content, server processing delay, and user expected latency. We evaluate ACTOR by applying it to over 2,000 4K video clips across two typical WiFi network settings. Extensive experimental results show that ACTOR consistently and significantly outperforms competitive methods for simultaneously meeting the latency and user-perceived video quality requirements. © 2021 ACM.",4K Video Processing; Adaptive Computation Offloading; Mobile Augmented reality; Super-resolution,"Ren J., Gao L., Wang X., Ma M., Qiu G., Wang H., Zheng J., Wang Z.",Article,"adaptive computation offload mobile augment reality augment reality ar underpin emerge mobile application increasingly require computation power well machine understanding user experience computation offload promise solution high quality interactive mobile ar exist method work well high definition video meet real time requirement emerge 4k video long uploading latency introduce actor novel computation offload framework 4k mobile ar reduce uploading latency actor dynamically judiciously downscale mobile video feed send remote server server leverage image super resolution technology scale receive video high quality object detection tracking rendering perform 4k resolution actor employ machine predict downscaling resolution super resolution configuration take account video content server processing delay user expect latency evaluate actor apply 2,000 4k video clip typical setting extensive experimental result actor consistently significantly outperform competitive method simultaneously meet latency user perceive video quality requirement acm 4k video processing adaptive computation offload mobile augment reality super resolution"

a semi-supervised transfer learning with dynamic associate domain adaptation for human activity recognition using wifi signals,2021.0,0.0,"Human activity recognition without equipment plays a vital role in smart home applications, freeing humans from the shackles of wearable devices. In this paper, by using the channel state information (CSI) of the WiFi signal, semi-supervised transfer learning with dynamic associate domain adaptation is proposed for human activity recognition. In order to improve the CSI quality and denoising of CSI, we carried out missing packet filling, burst noise removal, background estimation, feature extraction, feature enhancement, and data augmentation in the data pre-processing stage. This paper considers the problem of environment-independent human activity recognition, also known as domain adaptation. The pre-trained model is trained from the source domain by collecting a complete labeled dataset of all of the CSI of human activity patterns. Then, the pretrained model is transferred to the target environment through the semi-supervised transfer learning stage. Therefore, when humans move to different target domains, a partial labeled dataset of the target domain is required for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a dynamic associate domain adaptation called DADA. By modifying the existing associate domain adaptation algorithm, the target domain can provide a dynamic ratio of labeled dataset/unlabeled dataset, while the existing associate domain adaptation algorithm only allows target domains with the unlabeled dataset. The advantage of DADA is that it provides a dynamic strategy to eliminate different effects on different environments. In addition, we further designed an attention-based DenseNet model, or AD, as our training network, which is modified by an existing DenseNet by adding the attention function. The solution we proposed was simplified to DADA-AD throughout the paper. The experimental results show that for domain adaptation in different domains, the accuracy of human activity recognition of the DADA-AD scheme is 97.4%. It also shows that DADA-AD has advantages over existing semi-supervised learning schemes. © 2021 by the authors.

forecasting quality of service for next-generation data-driven wifi6 campus networks,2021.0,0.0,"Forecasting the users' movements and behaviors is extremely valuable for early warning systems to provide high-quality service in wireless and cellular networks. However, forecasting the service of the specific network devices with the additional knowledge of user behaviors is underexplored. This study proposes a WiFi6-specific QoS forecasting engine, which uses a spatio-temporal graph approach to predict QoS parameters, e.g., throughput, in terms of user position in WiFi6 networks. Since WiFi6 networks are planning to meet various traffic types with dense users, it is crucial to analyze it in both spatial and temporal manner by preserving graph-structured data. In this study, we modeled the problem with a novel deep learning approach, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs), by adapting the Omni-Scale 1D CNN for temporal analysis. Then, we analyze the forecasting performance with two datasets in terms of variety error metrics over loss rate, link speed, throughput, and round trip time (RTT). Also, we give the baselines, ARIMA, FARIMA, SVR, and RNN to compare the proposed solution in terms of accuracy. Finally, we present the simulation results to compare the proposed QoS forecasting approach with user mobility forecasting.

using machine learning to find the hidden relationship between rtt and tcp throughput in wifi,2021.0,0.0,"Is it possible to find hidden relationships among variables in WiFi network using machine learning (ML)? Can we use ML to find a variable that significantly affects the TCP throughput in WiFi? In this work, we employ a publicly available WiFi dataset to investigate these questions. We use ML techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), linear regression (LR), and random forest (RF), to study the effect of link speed, received signal strength, round-trip time (RTT), and number of available access points on TCP throughput in WiFi. More specifically, we are interested in employing ML to find the variable that most accurately predicts and thereby most significantly affects the throughput. Simple correlation analysis indicates that a combination of multiple variables is more likely to act as a reasonable predictor of the throughput, whereas a single variable, such as RTT, alone is not likely to predict the throughput with reasonable accuracy. From PCA, the first principal component (PC1) is seen as highly correlated to RTT. During predictive analysis, it is observed that the LR model is unable to find any hidden relationship between throughput and other variables. However, the RF model discovers that RTT explains the variation in throughput more closely and as such it predicts the throughput more accurately compared to other variables. PC1 captures nearly all of the variation in throughput with the RF model and predicts throughput with very high accuracy, which indirectly confirms RTT as the variable that most significantly affects the TCP throughput in WiFi. Consequently, we discover a very close relationship between RTT and TCP throughput using appropriate ML techniques, and these results can be helpful in developing a better understanding of the relationship between latency and throughput for designing future low-latency networks. © 2021, The Author(s).",Machine learning; Random forest; Round-trip time; TCP throughput; WiFi,Chaudhry A.U.,Article,machine find hide relationship rtt tcp throughput possible find hidden relationship variable machine ml use ml find variable significantly affect tcp throughput work employ publicly available dataset investigate question use ml technique include principal component   pca linear regression lr random forest rf effect link speed receive signal strength round trip time rtt number available access point tcp throughput specifically interested employ ml find variable accurately predict significantly affect throughput simple correlation indicate combination multiple variable likely act reasonable predictor throughput single variable rtt likely predict throughput reasonable accuracy pca principal component pc1 see highly correlate rtt predictive observe lr model unable find hide relationship throughput variable rf model discover rtt explain variation throughput closely predict throughput accurately compare variable pc1 capture nearly variation throughput rf model predict throughput high accuracy indirectly confirm rtt variable significantly affect tcp throughput consequently discover close relationship rtt tcp throughput appropriate ml technique result helpful develop well understanding relationship latency throughput design future low latency author(s machine random forest round trip time tcp throughput
"a smart building resource prediction, navigation and management system supported by radio tomography and computational intelligence",2021.0,0.0,"This article presents research results on a smart building prediction, navigation and asset management system. The main goal of this work was to combine all comfort subsystems, such as lighting, heating or air conditioning control, into one coherent management system supported by navigation using radio tomographic imaging techniques and computational intelligence in order to improve the building’s ability to track users and then maximize the energy efficiency of the building by analyzing their behavior. In addition, the data obtained in this way were used to increase the quality of navigation services, improve the safety and ergonomics of using the room access control system and create a centralized control panel enriched with records of the working time of individual people. The quality of the building’s user habit learning is ensured by a network of sensors collecting environmental data and thus the setting values of the comfort modules. The advantage of such a complex solution is an increase in the accuracy of navigation services provided, an improvement in the energy balance, an improvement in the level of safety and faster facility diagnostics. The solution uses proprietary small device assemblies with implementation of popular wireless transmission standards such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee or Z-Wave.

design and implementation of opportunity signal perception unit based on time-frequency representation and convolutional neural network,2021.0,0.0,"The traditional signal of opportunity (SOP) positioning system is equipped with dedicated receivers for each type of signal to ensure continuous signal perception. However, it causes a low equipment resources utilization and energy waste. With increasing SOP types, problems become more serious. This paper proposes a new signal perception unit for SOP positioning systems. By extracting the perception function from the positioning system and operating independently, the system can flexibly schedule resources and reduce waste based on the perception results. Through time-frequency joint representation, time-frequency image can be obtained which provides more information for signal recognition, and is difficult for traditional single time/frequency-domain analysis. We also designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for signal recognition and a negative learning method to correct the overfitting to noisy data. Finally, a prototype system was built using USRP and LabVIEW for a 2.4 GHz frequency band test. The results show that the system can effectively identify Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee signals at the same time, and verified the effectiveness of the proposed signal perception architecture. It can be further promoted to realize SOP perception in almost full frequency domain, and improve the integration and resource utilization efficiency of the SOP positioning system. © 2021 by the authors.

a domain-independent generative adversarial network for activity recognition using wifi csi data,2021.0,0.0,"Over the past years, device-free sensing has received considerable attention due to its unobtrusiveness. In this regard, context recognition using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) data has gained popularity, and various techniques have been proposed that combine unobtrusive sensing and deep learning to accurately detect various contexts ranging from human activities to gestures. However, research has shown that the performance of these techniques significantly degrades due to change in various factors including sensing environment, data collection configuration, diversity of target subjects, and target learning task (e.g., activities, gestures, emotions, vital signs). This problem, generally known as the domain change problem, is typically addressed by collecting more data and learning the data distribution that covers multiple factors impacting the performance. However, activity recognition data collection is a very labor-intensive and time consuming task, and there are too many known and unknown factors impacting WiFi CSI signals. In this paper, we propose a domain-independent generative adversarial network for WiFi CSI based activity recognition in combination with a simplified data pre-processing module.

evaluating the quality of high-resolution private sector data for providing nonfreeway travel times,2021.0,0.0,"Travel time to a destination is a key piece of information that motorists desire. Traditionally, transportation agencies collect traffic state information with costly measurement sensors. In the last decade, private sector data, as an emerging data source, has been gradually adopted by many public agencies for performance measurement and travel time provision, mostly on freeways. Agencies have also used data from infrastructure sensors and floating cars to validate the quality of the private sector data on both freeways and arterials under different conditions. Although freeway data quality has been validated by many studies, nonfreeway travel time data have been considered unreliable, particularly when the segment is congested and high-density signals exist. In recent years, data vendors started to provide high-resolution travel time data, which are provided on much shorter segments than conventional traffic message channels (TMC). This study investigates the data quality of this new data source for providing travel times on nonfreeways. It evaluates the selected private sector data on nonfreeways by using floating car and Wi-Fi travel time data as the ground truth. The results show that the new private sector data on nonfreeways are generally acceptable for segments with low and moderate congestion. With higher congestion, the data quality is site-dependent. A neural network model is proposed to implicitly identify the error of a site and provide enhanced travel times. It is recommended that these new data should be validated for the deployment sites due to the site-dependent errors, and advanced data modeling techniques can be used to compensate for such errors. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Data quality; Floating car; Private sector data; Travel time; Wi-Fi detector,"Liu Y., Adebisi A., Li T., Ma J.",Article,evaluate quality high resolution private sector provide nonfreeway travel times travel time destination key piece information motorist desire traditionally transportation agency collect traffic state information costly measurement sensor decade private sector emerge source gradually adopt public agency measurement travel time provision freeway agency infrastructure sensor float car validate quality private sector freeway arterial different condition freeway quality validate study nonfreeway travel time consider unreliable particularly segment congested high density signal exist recent year vendor start provide high resolution travel time provide short segment conventional traffic message channel tmc investigate quality new source provide travel time nonfreeway evaluate select private sector nonfreeway float car travel time ground truth result new private sector nonfreeway generally acceptable segment low moderate congestion high congestion quality site dependent neural model propose implicitly identify error site provide enhance travel time recommend new validate deployment site site dependent error advanced model technique compensate error american society civil engineer quality float car private sector travel time detector
occupancy-based energy consumption modelling using machine learning algorithms for institutional buildings,2021.0,2.0,"Occupancy information is one of the crucial variables in modelling and predicting the energy use in buildings. However, the presence of occupants is often stochastic in nature. In the presented case of eight space typologies derived from three institutional building blocks, a substantial variation in the correlation between occupancy and energy consumption is found for different space types during the semester and semester breaks for various resolutions of day and time. Further, it has been identified that a weak correlation between occupants and energy use is due to the use of common plug and lighting loads such as office printers, projectors, lab instruments, and fluorescent lamps. However, in the spaces studied, such as offices and computer rooms, the control of plug and lighting loads can be at individual occupancy levels for avoiding energy wastages. To characterize occupancy and energy consumption patterns by different space types and occupant types, this study develops and presents an integrated, data-driven modelling framework and results for different space types (like classrooms, studios, computer rooms, office spaces and laboratories and time resolution (hourly to semester-long intervals) for the case study building. It is found that the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model exhibits a slightly better prediction accuracy than conventional machine learning/regression models such as gradient boosting, support-vector network, and feed-forward neural network. However, in terms of computation time, the gradient boosting model is found to be faster than the DNN model for comparable outcomes.

deepfir: channel-robust physical-layer deep learning through adaptive waveform filtering,2021.0,0.0,"Deep learning can be used to classify waveform characteristics (e.g., modulation) with accuracy levels that are hardly attainable with traditional techniques. Recent research has demonstrated that one of the most crucial challenges in wireless deep learning is to counteract the channel action, which may significantly alter the waveform features. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that deep learning algorithms are hardly re-trainable in real time due to their sheer size. This paper proposes DeepFIR, a framework to counteract the channel action in wireless deep learning algorithms without retraining the underlying deep learning model. The key intuition is that through the application of a carefully-optimized digital finite input response filter (FIR) at the transmitter's side, we can apply tiny modifications to the waveform to strengthen its features according to the current channel conditions. We mathematically formulate the Waveform Optimization Problem (WOP) as the problem of finding the optimum FIR to be used on a waveform to improve the classifier's accuracy. We also propose a data-driven methodology to train the FIRs directly with dataset inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepFIR on an experimental testbed of 20 software-defined radios, as well as on two datasets made up by 500 ADS-B devices and by 500 WiFi devices and a 24-class modulation dataset. Experimental results show that our approach (i) increases the accuracy of the radio fingerprinting models by about 35%, 50% and 58%; (ii) decreases an adversary's accuracy by about 54% when trying to imitate other device's fingerprints by using their filters; (iii) achieves 27% improvement over the state of the art on a 100-device dataset; (iv) increases by 2× the accuracy of the modulation dataset. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",datasets; Deep learning; security; software-defined radio; testbed; wireless,"Restuccia F., D'Oro S., Al-Shawabka A., Rendon B.C., Ioannidis S., Melodia T.",Article,deepfir channel robust physical layer deep adaptive waveform filter deep classify waveform characteristic e.g. modulation accuracy level hardly attainable traditional technique recent demonstrate crucial challenge deep counteract channel action significantly alter waveform feature problem exacerbate fact deep algorithm hardly trainable real time sheer size propose deepfir framework counteract channel action deep algorithm retrain underlie deep model key intuition application carefully optimize digital finite input response filter fir transmitter apply tiny modification waveform strengthen feature accord current channel condition mathematically formulate waveform optimization problem wop problem find optimum fir waveform improve classifier accuracy drive methodology train fir directly dataset input extensively evaluate deepfir experimental testbe software define radio dataset ad b device device class modulation dataset experimental result approach increase accuracy radio fingerprinting model ii decrease adversary accuracy try imitate device fingerprint filter iii achieve improvement state art device dataset iv increase 2× accuracy modulation dataset dataset deep security software define radio testbe
deepcc: multi-agent deep reinforcement learning congestion control for multi-path tcp based on self-attention,2021.0,3.0,"With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G, there are ubiquitous smart devices and network functions providing emerging network services efficiently and optimally through building many network connections based on WiFi, LTE/5G, Ethernet, and etc. The Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol that enables these devices to establish multiple paths for simultaneous data transmission, has been a widely used extension of standard TCP in smart devices and network functions. On the other hand, more heavy and time-varying traffic loads are generated in an MPTCP network, so that an efficient congestion control mechanism that schedules the traffic between multiple subflows and avoids congestion is highly required. In this paper, we propose a decentralized learning approach, DeepCC, to adapt to the volatile environments and realize the efficient congestion control. The Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) is used to learn a policy of congestion control for each subflow according to the real-time network states. To deal with the problem of the fixed state space and slow convergence, we adopt two self-attention mechanisms to receive the states and train the policy, respectively. Due to the asynchronous design of DeepCC, the learning process will not introduce extra delay and overhead on the decision-making process. Experiment results show that DeepCC consistently outperforms the well-known heuristic method and DRL-based MPTCP congestion control method in terms of goodput and jitter. Besides, DeepCC with the attention mechanism reduces convergence time by about 50% and increase goodput by about 80% compared with the commonly used structures of neural networks. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",congestion control; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; Multi-path TCP; self-attention,"He B., Wang J., Qi Q., Sun H., Liao J., Du C., Yang X., Han Z.",Article,deepcc multi agent deep reinforcement congestion control multi path tcp base self attention development internet thing iot g ubiquitous smart device function provide emerge service efficiently optimally build connection base lte/5 g ethernet etc multipath tcp mptcp protocol enable device establish multiple path simultaneous transmission widely extension standard tcp smart device function hand heavy time vary traffic load generate mptcp efficient congestion control mechanism schedule traffic multiple subflow avoid congestion highly require decentralized approach deepcc adapt volatile environment realize efficient congestion control multi agent deep reinforcement madrl policy congestion control subflow accord real time state deal problem fix state space slow convergence adopt self attention mechanism receive state train policy respectively asynchronous design deepcc process introduce extra delay overhead decision make process experiment result deepcc consistently outperform know heuristic drl base mptcp congestion control term goodput jitter deepcc attention mechanism reduce convergence time increase goodput compare commonly structure neural congestion control multi agent deep reinforcement multi path tcp self attention
wi-fi based non-invasive detection of indoor wandering using lstm model,2021.0,0.0,"Wandering is a significant indicator in the clinical diagnosis of dementia and other related diseases for elders. Reliable monitoring of long-term continuous movement in indoor setting for detection of wandering movement is challenging because most elders are prone to forget to carry or wear sensors that collect motion information daily due to their declining memory. Wi-Fi as an emerging sensing modality has been widely used to monitor human indoor movement in a non-invasive manner. In order to continuously monitor individuals’ indoor motion and reliably identify wandering movement in a non-invasive manner, in this work, we develop a LSTM-based deep classification method that is able to differentiate the wandering-caused Wi-Fi signal change from the others.

shared spectrum monitoring using deep learning,2021.0,3.0,"Shared spectrum usage is inevitable due to the ongoing increase in wireless services and bandwidth requirements. Spectrum monitoring is a key enabler for efficient spectrum sharing by multiple radio access technologies (RATs). In this paper, we present signal classification using deep neural networks to identify various radio technologies and their associated interferences. We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to perform signal classification and employ six well-known CNN models to train for ten signal classes. These classes include LTE, Radar, WiFi and FBMC (Filter Bank Multicarrier) and their interference combinations, which include, LTE + Radar, LTE + WiFi, FBMC + Radar, FBMC + WiFi, WiFi + Radar and Noise. The CNN models include, AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, InceptionV3 and ResNet50. The radio signal data sets for training and testing of CNN-based classifiers are acquired using a USRP-based experimental setup. Extensive measurements of these radio technologies (LTE, WiFi, Radar and FBMC) are done over different locations and times to generate a robust dataset. We propose a novel (spectrogram) representation called the Quarter-spectrogram (Q-spectrogram) that squeezes temporal and frequency information for input to CNN models. While considering classification accuracy, model complexity and prediction time for a single input Q-spectrogram (image), ResNet18 (CNN model) gives the best overall performance with 98% classification accuracy. While SqueezeNet (CNN model) offers the lowest model complexity which makes it very suitable for resource-constrained radio monitoring devices and also offers the least prediction time of 110 msec. Moreover, we also propose a simple WiFi classification scheme that buffers several WiFi Q-spectrograms and then makes a decision about WiFi's presence and also gives a quantified measure of WiFi traffic density. © 2021 IEEE.",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Heterogeneous networks; Interference classification; Radio access technologies classification; Spectrum monitoring; Spectrum sharing,"Bhatti F.A., Khan M.J., Selim A., Paisana F.",Article,share spectrum monitoring deep share spectrum usage inevitable ongoing increase service bandwidth requirement spectrum monitoring key enabler efficient spectrum sharing multiple radio access technology rat present signal classification deep neural identify radio technology associated interference use convolutional neural cnn perform signal classification employ know cnn model train signal class class include lte radar fbmc filter bank multicarri interference combination include lte + radar lte + fbmc + radar fbmc + + radar noise cnn model include alexnet vgg16 resnet18 squeezenet inceptionv3 resnet50 radio signal set training testing cnn base classifier acquire usrp base experimental setup extensive measurement radio technology lte radar fbmc different location time generate robust dataset novel spectrogram representation call quarter spectrogram q spectrogram squeeze temporal frequency information input cnn model consider classification accuracy model complexity prediction time single input q spectrogram image resnet18 cnn model give good overall classification accuracy squeezenet cnn model offer low model complexity make suitable resource constrain radio monitoring device offer prediction time msec simple classification scheme buffer q spectrogram make decision presence give quantified measure traffic density convolutional neural deep heterogeneous interference classification radio access technology classification spectrum monitoring spectrum sharing
a novel wifi gesture recognition method based on cnn-lstm and channel attention,2021.0,0.0,"With the rapid development of wireless sensing, intelligent human-computer interaction, and other fields, gesture recognition based on WiFi has become an important research field. Gesture recognition based on WiFi has the advantages of non-contact and privacy protection. In addition, the use of home WiFi makes the technology have a broad application scenario. At present, most gesture recognition models based on WiFi can only achieve good results in a specific domain.

discriminating btx molecules by the nonselective metal oxide sensor-based smart sensing system,2021.0,0.0,"Discriminating structurally similar volatile organic compounds (VOCs) molecules, such as benzene, toluene, and three xylene isomers (BTX), remains a significant challenge, especially, for metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors, in which selectivity is a long-standing challenge. Recent progress indicates that temperature modulation of a single MOS sensor offers a powerful route in extracting the features of adsorbed gas analytes than conventional isothermal operation. Herein, a rectangular heating waveform is applied on NiO-, WO3-, and SnO2-based sensors to gradually activate the specific gas/oxide interfacial redox reaction and generate rich (electrical) features of adsorbed BTX molecules. Upon several signal preprocessing steps, the intrinsic feature of BTX molecules can be extracted by the linear discrimination analysis (LDA) or convolutional neural network (CNN) analysis. The combination of three distinct MOS sensors noticeably benefits the recognition accuracy (with a reduced number of training iterations).

discriminant model of tomato nitrogen deficiency based on weighted random forest [基于加权随机森林的番茄氮元素缺乏分级模型研究],2021.0,0.0,"Determining and classifying nitrogen deficiency is important for tomato planting. A nitrogen deficiency classification model based on the leaf color features of tomato was proposed. The accuracy of the proposed model can reach over 0.80. The leaf surface of tomatoes planted in summer were covered with glandular hairs. The glandular hairs were conducive to the absorption of water and nutrient elements in a tomato leaf. Under the same concentration of a nutrient solution, the yellowing process of these leaves was different from that of leaves without glandular hairs. Therefore, the accuracy of the classification model based only on leaf color features was reduced to 0.65. The two shape features, namely, the circumference and area of the hair-covered tomato leaves, were both smaller than those of the hairless tomato leaves. Thus, the two shape features of tomato leaf combined with the original leaf color features were used as model inputs to build a new nitrogen deficiency classification model for tomato. The image acquisition unit was constructed using Raspberry Pi and its camera module. Wireless data transmission among smartphones, image acquisition units and local computers was completed using WiFi or a 4G network. Smartphones remotely controlled the acquisition of images and transferred the obtained images through the Web interface to a cloud platform for storage. The local computer preprocessed the images to extract the leaf shape and color features, input the model for prediction, and output the prediction result. The test results showed that the image acquisition system worked properly with temperature ranging from 19.7℃ to 28.3℃ in spring and summer, and the illumination was in the range of 1 125~9 543 lx. Preprocessing and segmentation of the acquired images removed any influence of the environment.

a cnn-based csi fingerprint indoor localization method [一种基于卷积神经网络的csi指纹室内定位方法],2021.0,0.0,"To improve the performance of Wi-Fi fingerprint indoor positioning technology, a method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for channel state information (CSI) fingerprint indoor positioning is proposed. This method fully exploits the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs, applies the combination of amplitude difference and phase difference information as training data in the offline phase, and uses the trained CNN network model for an online test. In the online phase, for different experimental scenarios, by analyzing the variance of the amplitude information and phase information, the amplitude difference and phase difference information of the test data are weighted to obtain a certain universal weight factor for a better positioning result. At the same time, considering the characteristics of terminal mobility during real-time positioning, the CSI information sampled twice in succession is adopted as test data to increase the diversity of test data. To address the disadvantage of poor positioning performance of traditional probability-based positioning algorithms, an improved probability-based fingerprint matching algorithm is introduced. By passing the CSI information of the point to be located through the CNN network model, it can output the probability average value corresponding to the reference position with the highest probability in all test data packets and weight it with the reference position coordinate to estimate the point to be located. In addition, to enhance the universality of the algorithm, a dual-node positioning scheme is proposed for complex indoor scenes to improve positioning accuracy. Experiments are conducted in two positioning scenarios in a corridor and laboratory, including the amplitude difference positioning performance, the average positioning error of each positioning method, and the performance comparison of positioning algorithms. The information joint positioning algorithm obtains an average positioning error of 24.7 and 48.1 cm, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2021, Science Press.

no reservations required: achieving fairness between wi-fi and nr-u with self-deferral only,2021.0,1.0,"Wireless technologies coexisting in unlicensed bands should receive a fair share of the available channel resources, even when they use different access methods. We consider the problem of coexistence between Wi-Fi and New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) nodes, which employ, respectively, a random and scheduled access scheme. The latter typically resorts to reservation signals (RSs), which allow keeping the control of the channel until the start of the next synchronized slot. This mechanism, although effective for increasing the channel access opportunities of scheduled-based nodes, is also a waste of channel resources. We investigate alternative solutions, based on self-deferral only. We built analytical and simulations models for a Wi-Fi and NR-U coexistence scenario and found that (a) airtime fairness can be achieved with proper contention window (CW) settings and (b) this solution can be exploited for optimizing network performance for both Wi-Fi and NR-U. Additionally, we demonstrate how an artificial recurrent neural network-based regression model can be applied to predict such proper CW settings. Our research confirms that by embedding contending devices with machine learning intelligence in CW selection, scheduled-based systems such as NR-U do not have to resort to RSs. © 2021 Owner/Author.",coexistence; LAA; machine learning; NR-U; Wi-Fi,"Tinnirello I., Lo Valvo A., Szott S., Kosek-Szott K.",Conference Paper,reservation require achieve fairness nr u self deferral technology coexist unlicensed band receive fair share available channel resource use different access method consider problem coexistence new radio unlicense nr u node employ respectively random schedule access scheme typically resort reservation signal rss allow keep control channel start synchronize slot mechanism effective increase channel access opportunity schedule base node waste channel resource investigate alternative solution base self deferral build analytical simulation model nr u coexistence scenario find airtime fairness achieve proper contention window cw setting b solution exploit optimize nr u. additionally demonstrate artificial recurrent neural base regression model apply predict proper cw setting confirm embed contending device machine intelligence cw selection schedule base system nr u resort rss owner author coexistence laa machine nr u

However, there are several common issues in public datasets, such as short time duration, lack of appearance change, and limited activities, resulting in un-robust models.

units: short-time fourier inspired neural networks for sensory time series classification,2021.0,0.0,"Discovering patterns in time series data is essential to many key tasks in intelligent sensing systems, such as human activity recognition and event detection. These tasks involve the classification of sensory information from physical measurements such as inertial or temperature change measurements. Due to differences in the underlying physics, existing methods for classification use handcrafted features combined with traditional learning algorithms, or employ distinct deep neural models to directly learn from raw data. We propose here a unified neural architecture, UniTS, for sensory time series classification in various tasks, which obviates the need for domain-specific feature, model customization or polished hyper-parameter tuning. This is possible as we believe that discriminative patterns in sensory measurements would manifest when we combine information from both the time and frequency domains. In particular, to reveal the commonality of sensory signals, we integrate Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) into neural networks by initializing convolutional filter weights as the Fourier coefficients. Instead of treating STFT as a static linear transform with fixed coefficients, we make these weights optimizable during network training, which essentially learns to weigh each frequency channel. Recognizing that time-domain signals might represent intuitive physics such as temperature and acceleration, we combine linearly transformed time-domain hidden features with the frequency components within each time chunk. We further extend our model to multiple branches with different time-frequency resolutions to avoid the need of hyper-parameter search. We conducted experiments on four public datasets containing time-series data from various IoT systems, including motion, WiFi, EEG, and air quality, and compared UniTS with numerous recent models. Results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an average F1 score of 91.85% with a 2.3-point improvement over the state of the art.

For feature extraction, we perform a comprehensive data analytics to mine vital features to label each AP, which are extracted and classified into three categories, i.e., individual features, spatial features, and temporal features. For the model design, we design a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model, which contains two separate RNNs, i.e., the encoder RNN and decoder RNN. Particularly, the sequential feature vectors are injected into the encoder RNN to learn the 'semantic' information, based on which the decoder RNN conducts sequential AP-level predictions. As the semantic vector is injected for each time step prediction, it can effectively reduce the accumulated prediction errors, which enable long period of time predictions.

monofi: efficient indoor localization based on single radio source and minimal fingerprinting,2021.0,1.0,"Indoor localization is a key component of pervasive and mobile computing. Due to the widespread use of WiFi technology, WiFi fingerprinting is one of the most widely utilized approaches for indoor localization. Despite advancements in WiFi-based positioning approaches, existing solutions necessitate a dense deployment of access points, time-consuming manual fingerprinting, and/or special hardware. In this paper, we propose MonoFi, a novel WiFi-based indoor localization system relying only on the received signal strength from a single access point. To compensate for the low amount of information available for learning, the system trains a recurrent neural network with sequences of signal measurements.

generative adversarial networks for generating synthetic features for wi-fi signal quality,2021.0,0.0,"Wireless networks are among the fundamental technologies used to connect people. Considering the constant advancements in the field, telecommunication operators must guarantee a high-quality service to keep their customer portfolio. To ensure this high-quality service, it is common to establish partnerships with specialized technology companies that deliver software services in order to monitor the networks and identify faults and respective solutions. A common barrier faced by these specialized companies is the lack of data to develop and test their products. This paper investigates the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are state-of-the-art generative models, for generating synthetic telecommunication data related to Wi-Fi signal quality. We developed, trained, and compared two of the most used GAN architectures: The Vanilla GAN and the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Both models presented satisfactory results and were able to generate synthetic data similar to the real ones. In particular, the distribution of the synthetic data overlaps the distribution of the real data for all of the considered features. Moreover, the considered generative models can reproduce the same associations observed for the synthetic features. We chose the WGAN as the final model, but both models are suitable for addressing the problem at hand. © 2021 Castelli et al.

sensor-fusion for smartphone location tracking using hybrid multimodal deep neural networks,2021.0,0.0,"Many engineered approaches have been proposed over the years for solving the hard problem of performing indoor localization using smartphone sensors. However, specialising these solutions for difficult edge cases remains challenging. Here we propose an end-to-end hybrid multimodal deep neural network localization system, MM-Loc, relying on zero hand-engineered features, but learning automatically from data instead. This is achieved by using modality-specific neural networks to extract preliminary features from each sensing modality, which are then combined by cross-modality neural structures. We show that our choice of modality-specific neural architectures can estimate the location independently. But for better accuracy, a multimodal neural network that fuses the features of early modality-specific representations is a better proposition. Our proposed MM-Loc system is tested on cross-modality samples characterised by different sampling rate and data representation (inertial sensors, magnetic and WiFi signals), outperforming traditional approaches for location estimation. MM-Loc elegantly trains directly from data unlike conventional indoor positioning systems, which rely on human intuition. © 2021 by the authors.

meta-wf: meta-learning-based few-shot wireless impersonation detection for wi-fi networks,2021.0,0.0,"As the common wireless open medium of the Internet of Things (IoT), Wi-Fi networks are often suffering from impersonation attacks.

continuous authentication through finger gesture interaction for smart homes using wifi,2021.0,2.0,"The development of smart homes has advanced the concept of user authentication to not only protecting user privacy but also facilitating personalized services to users. Along this direction, we propose to integrate user authentication with human-computer interactions between users and smart household appliances through widely-deployed WiFi infrastructures, which is non-intrusive and device-free. In this paper, we propose $FingerPass$FingerPass which leverages channel state information (CSI) of surrounding WiFi signals to continuously authenticate users through finger gestures in smart homes. $FingerPass$FingerPass separates the user authentication process into two stages, login and interaction, to achieve high authentication accuracy and low response latency simultaneously. In the login stage, we develop a deep learning-based approach to extract behavioral characteristics of finger gestures for highly accurate user identification. For the interaction stage, to provide continuous authentication in real time for satisfactory user experience, we design a verification mechanism with lightweight classifiers to continuously authenticate the user's identity during each interaction of finger gestures. Experiments in real environments show that $FingerPass$FingerPass can achieve the authentication accuracies of 90.6 percent under in-domain scenarios and 87.6 percent under cross-domain scenarios, as well as $186.6\;ms$186.6ms response time during interactions. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",Continuous authentication; finger gesture; smart home; WiFi signals,"Kong H., Lu L., Yu J., Chen Y., Tang F.",Article,continuous authentication finger gesture interaction smart home development smart home advance concept user authentication protect user privacy facilitate personalized service user direction integrate user authentication human computer interaction user smart household appliance widely deploy infrastructure non intrusive device free $ fingerpass$fingerpass leverage channel state information csi surround signal continuously authenticate user finger gesture smart home $ fingerpass$fingerpass separate user authentication process stage login interaction achieve high authentication accuracy low response latency simultaneously login stage develop deep base approach extract behavioral characteristic finger gesture highly accurate user identification interaction stage provide continuous authentication real time satisfactory user experience design verification mechanism lightweight classifier continuously authenticate user identity interaction finger gesture experiment real environment $ fingerpass$fingerpass achieve authentication accuracy 90.6 percent domain scenario 87.6 percent cross domain scenario $ 186.6\;ms$186.6ms response time interaction continuous authentication finger gesture smart home signal
emergency semantic feature vector extraction from wifi signals for in-home monitoring of elderly,2021.0,2.0,"The elderly population worldwide is growing drastically. Most elders prefer to live independently in their own homes, which makes them more vulnerable to emergencies and leads to higher death rates. Timely detection and notification of emergencies can minimize the impact of the adversity. In this paper, we try to extract the Emergency Semantic Feature Vector ($ESFV$) from the ubiquitous WiFi signals in indoor environments for non-intrusive, cost-effective monitoring of the elderly and effective emergency notification. Common emergencies of the elderly are analyzed and an $ESFV$ is defined as $ESFV = ({\lbrace \pi \rbrace,\lbrace \beta \rbrace, \lbrace \rho \rbrace })$, which is a combination of the Position, (abnormal) Behavior and (abnormal) Respiration of the elderly. To extract the $ESFV$ from WiFi signals, we design a WiFi signal structuring approach, which converts WiFi signals into two structured features, i.e., keypoint maps and respiration graphs, using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). For keypoint map construction, we extract human-related WiFi signals, based on which we generate CSI maps. Meanwhile, a synchronized camera is used to extract human keypoints and annotate WiFi signals. A neural network is designed to transform the CSI maps into keypoint maps. For respiration graph extraction, we design a respiration-related WiFi signal extraction method and a subcarrier selection algorithm to obtain the respiration graphs. Then we extract the $\lbrace \pi \rbrace$, $\lbrace \beta \rbrace$, $\lbrace \rho \rbrace$ from the two structured features: $\lbrace \pi \rbrace$ and $\lbrace \beta \rbrace$ are extracted from the keypoint maps while $\lbrace \rho \rbrace$ is extracted from the respiration graphs. Finally, the feature vector $(\lbrace \pi \rbrace,\lbrace \beta \rbrace, \lbrace \rho \rbrace)$ of an emergency semantic is formed for notification. We build a prototype system and conduct extensive experiments. Experiment results show that our approaches perform well in both signal structuring (keypoint map construction and respiration graph extraction) and $ESFV$ extraction. These demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches for in-home monitoring and emergency notification. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",CSI; Emergency semantic feature vector extraction; in-home monitoring; signal structuring; WiFi,"Guo L., Lu Z., Zhou S., Wen X., He Z.",Article,"emergency semantic feature vector extraction signal home monitoring elderly elderly population worldwide grow drastically elder prefer live independently home make vulnerable emergency lead high death rate timely detection notification emergency minimize impact adversity try extract emergency semantic feature vector $ esfv$ ubiquitous signal indoor environment non intrusive cost effective monitoring elderly effective emergency notification common emergency elderly analyze $ esfv$ define $ esfv = \lbrace \pi \rbrace,\lbrace \beta \rbrace \lbrace \rho \rbrace $ combination position abnormal behavior abnormal respiration elderly extract $ esfv$ signal design signal structuring approach convert signal structured feature i.e. keypoint map respiration graph channel state information csi keypoint map construction extract human relate signal base generate csi map synchronize camera extract human keypoint annotate signal neural design transform csi map keypoint map respiration graph extraction design respiration relate signal extraction subcarri selection algorithm obtain respiration graph extract $ \lbrace \pi \rbrace$ $ \lbrace \beta \rbrace$ $ \lbrace \rho \rbrace$ structured feature $ \lbrace \pi \rbrace$ $ \lbrace \beta \rbrace$ extract keypoint map $ \lbrace \rho \rbrace$ extract respiration graph finally feature vector $ \lbrace \pi \rbrace,\lbrace \beta \rbrace \lbrace \rho \rbrace)$ emergency semantic form notification build prototype conduct extensive experiment experiment result approach perform signal structuring keypoint map construction respiration graph extraction $ esfv$ extraction demonstrate effectiveness approach home monitoring emergency notification csi emergency semantic feature vector extraction home monitoring signal structuring"
jamming detection at the edge of drone networks using multi-layer perceptrons and decision trees,2021.0,0.0,"As wireless networks play an increasingly key role in everyday life, it is necessary to secure them from radio frequency attacks, such as jamming, which are hard to detect, especially because they may be easily mistaken for other network conditions. Within this challenging context, the paper proposes a framework for jamming detection in drone networks, relying on a distributed approach based on supervised machine learning techniques, namely, Multi-layer Perceptrons and Decision Trees. Given a reference data packet trace set, our framework computes the features of some predefined metrics, such as throughput, PDR and RSSI, which vary during a jamming attack, and that can therefore be used to detect it. We evaluate our framework using datasets from publicly available standardized jamming attack scenarios with IEEE 802.11p radio data, and via ns3-based simulation datasets from networks of drones using WiFi. We show that the performance of the classifiers improves as the sampling time of the packets decreases. We also show that the Multi-layer Perceptron can be effectively generalized to achieve jamming detection accuracy superior to that of Decision Trees even when applied to communication scenarios for which it has not been specifically trained. Our proposed framework reaches a satisfactory accuracy level of 96%, while requiring low computational and hardware capabilities, thus proving to be suitable for resource-constrained drone networks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Drone networks; Jamming detection; Machine learning,"Greco C., Pace P., Basagni S., Fortino G.",Article,jam detection edge drone multi layer perceptron decision tree play increasingly key role everyday life necessary secure radio frequency attack jamming hard detect especially easily mistake condition challenging context propose framework jam detection drone rely distribute approach base supervised machine technique multi layer perceptron decision tree give reference packet trace set framework compute feature predefine metric throughput pdr rssi vary jamming attack detect evaluate framework dataset publicly available standardized jamming attack scenario 802.11p radio ns3 base simulation dataset drone classifier improve sampling time packet decrease multi layer perceptron effectively generalize achieve jam detection accuracy superior decision tree apply communication scenario specifically train propose framework reach satisfactory accuracy level require low computational hardware capability prove suitable resource constrain drone elsevi b.v drone jam detection machine
area human sensing via ambient wi-fi signals,2021.0,0.0,"Indoor human wireless sensing is crucial for many applications such as smart homes and security monitoring. It needs to understand both the number of people and their activities, which is often difficult, especially in large spaces. This paper proposes a combined people number counting and action recognition method by using the channel state information (CSI) of Wi-Fi signal, which aims to simultaneously estimate the number of people and their actions in wireless sensing applications. First, a jump region removal algorithm is developed to calibrate the phase difference. Second, a cumulative sliding variance algorithm is designed for the detection of moving targets in the environment. Then a multi-dimensional feature is formed by the amplitude, frequency domain, and phase difference of CSI, and based on it, a two-level classifier based on the SVM algorithm is used to estimate the number of people and their actions. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of the system for the people counting is 93.5%, and the activity recognition rate of one-person and two-person is 99.6% and 94.6% respectively. © 2021 The Authors.

multiclass moisture classification in woodchips using iiot wi-fi and machine learning techniques,2021.0,1.0,"For the pulping process in a pulp & paper plant that uses woodchips as raw material, the moisture content (MC) of the woodchips is a major process disturbance that affects product quality and consumption of energy, water and chemicals. Existing woodchip MC sensing technologies have not been widely adopted by the industry due to unreliable performance and/or high maintenance requirements that can hardly be met in a manufacturing environment. To address these limitations, we propose a non-destructive, economic, and robust woodchip MC sensing approach utilizing channel state information (CSI) from industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) based Wi-Fi. While these IIoT devices are small, low-cost, and rugged to stand for harsh environment, they do have their limitations such as the raw CSI data are often very noisy and sensitive to woodchip packing. To address this, statistics pattern analysis (SPA) is utilized to extract physically and/or statistically meaningful features from the raw CSI data, which are sensitive to woodchip MC but not to packing. The SPA features are then used for developing multiclass classification models using various linear and nonlinear machine learning techniques to provide potential solutions to woodchip MC estimation for the pulp and paper industry.

real-time localisation system for gps-denied open areas using smart street furniture,2021.0,0.0,"Wifi-based localisation systems have gained significant interest with many researchers proposing different localisation techniques using publicly available datasets. However, these datasets are limited because they only contain Wifi fingerprints collected and labelled by users, and they are restricted to indoor locations. We have generated the first Wifi-based localisation datasets for a GPS-denied open area. We selected a busy open area at Murdoch University to generate the datasets using so-called “smart bins”, which are rubbish bins that we enabled to work as access points. The data gathered consists of two different datasets. In the first, four users generated labelled WiFi fingerprints for all available Reference Points using four different smartphones. The second dataset includes 2450865 auto-generated rows received from more than 1000 devices. We have developed a light-weight algorithm to label the second dataset from the first and we proposed a localisation approach that converts the second dataset from asynchronous format to synchronous, applies feature engineering and a deep learning classifier.

improved k-nearest neighbor algorithm for indoor positioning using 5g channel state information,2021.0,0.0,"As the demand for location-based services in indoor environments continues to grow, indoor positioning systems have attracted more and more attention. At present, the commonly used positioning system is based on the received signal strength of the WiFi network positioning algorithm. However, with the vigorous development of the fifth-generation(5G) mobile communication technology, the positioning accuracy can be greatly improved, and more accurate indoor positioning can be achieved. In order to improve the positioning accuracy, a positioning algorithm based on the channel state information reference signal is proposed. By using the smooth rank sequence (SRS) algorithm in the estimation of the number of received signal paths, the estimation accuracy of the angle of arrival(AoA) and the time of flight(ToF) can be improved. The combination of Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) and the Expected Maximum(EM) algorithm further ensures the construction of offline fingerprint database. Besides, the online matching algorithm of fingerprint database is improved, and an improved k nearest neighbor algorithm is proposed.

adaptive channel hopping for ieee 802.15.4 tsch-based networks: a dynamic bernoulli bandit approach,2021.0,0.0,"In IEEE 802.15.4 standard for low-power low-range wireless communications, only one channel is employed for transmission which can result in increased energy consumption, high network delay and poor packet delivery ratio (PDR). In the subsequent IEEE 802.15.4-2015 standard, a Time-slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mechanism has been developed which allows for a periodic yet fixed frequency hopping pattern over 16 different channels. Unfortunately, however, most of these channels are susceptible to high-power coexisting Wi-Fi signal interference and to possibly some other ISM-band transmissions. This interference manifests itself in the form of the presence/absence of other devices with either or both static and dynamic channel selection policies. In order to isolate channels with undesirable conditions, blacklisting mechanisms are defined to adapt the channel hopping process. However, the existing solutions which form blacklists unrealistically assume that the statistical model of the external interference remains fixed, and do not vary over time. In this paper, we realistically assume that the impact of external interferes on 802.15.4 may generally follow a non-stationary pattern, and accordingly formulate the adaptive channel hopping problem as a Dynamic Multi-Armed Bernoulli Bandit (Dynamic MABB) process from the machine learning theory. We then propose an online learning algorithm with track-ability properties for computing an adaptive hopping policy. Simulations confirm that when the statistics of the external interference has a switching regime, the proposed solution outperforms the previous schemes in terms of both energy efficiency as well as two important KPIs for TSCH-based networks, i.e., PDR and latency. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",Blacklisting; Channel hopping; Dynamic MABB problem; IEEE 802.15.4; TSCH,"Javan N.T., Sabaei M., Hakami V.",Article,adaptive channel hop 802.15.4 tsch base dynamic bernoulli bandit approach 802.15.4 standard low power low range communication channel employ transmission result increase energy consumption high delay poor packet delivery ratio pdr subsequent 802.15.4 standard time slot channel hop tsch mechanism develop allow periodic fix frequency hop pattern different channel unfortunately channel susceptible high power coexist signal interference possibly ism band transmission interference manifest form presence absence device static dynamic channel selection policy order isolate channel undesirable condition blacklist mechanism define adapt channel hop process exist solution form blacklist unrealistically assume statistical model external interference remains fix vary time realistically assume impact external interfere 802.15.4 generally follow non stationary pattern accordingly formulate adaptive channel hop problem dynamic multi armed bernoulli bandit dynamic mabb process machine theory online algorithm track ability property compute adaptive hopping policy simulation confirm statistic external interference switch regime propose solution outperform previous scheme term energy efficiency important kpis tsch base i.e. pdr latency blacklist channel hopping dynamic mabb problem 802.15.4 tsch

improving human action recognition by jointly exploiting video and wifi clues,2021.0,0.0,"Recent years have witnessed the increasing attentions on human action recognition(HAR). Traditional methods are prone to explore the optimum spatiotemporal feature representation of human actions in video clips so as to achieve high recognition performance. However, the optical limitations, such as inappropriate view, dim illumination and object occlusion, usually degrade video quality and affect the recognition performance a lot. Considering that wireless signals are robust against optical limitations, we thus incorporate WiFi signals with video streams for HAR. Specifically, we use WiFi Channel State Information as a compensator for video streams. A great challenge is how to effectively fuse the video and WiFi information to achieve better prediction performance. To this end, we employ convolution neural networks and statistic analysis algorithms to extract video and WiFi features respectively, and propose a novel multi-modal learning approach for video and WiFi feature fusion, where the video and WiFi features are projected to a common space by supervised learning.

By understanding variations in WiFi radio signals with channel state information (CSI) and machine learning models, we evaluate the proposed soil sensing system through experiments on physical soil traits such as soil moisture content, soil texture and position. Moreover, we also demonstrate how a mesh network of WiFi sensing devices allows us to predict the physical traits of the soil in the area between each pair of sensors, allowing for an increase in sensing area coverage as nodes are added. © 2021 IEEE.",Precision agriculture; Sensor networks; Soil moisture; Soil sensing; WiFi sensing,"Hernandez S.M., Erdag D., Bulut E.",Conference Paper,dense scalable soil sense low cost sensing precision agriculture use precise sensor collect farmland farmer well insight land allow great crop yield reduce resource usage exist solution require high hardware cost limit large scale deployment address low cost scalable solution sense physical attribute soil iot base sensing device understand variation radio signal channel state information csi machine model evaluate propose soil sense experiment physical soil trait soil moisture content soil texture position demonstrate mesh sensing device allow predict physical trait soil area pair sensor allow increase sense area coverage node add precision agriculture sensor soil moisture soil sense sense
wifipositioning in 3gpp indoor office with modified particle swarm optimization,2021.0,0.0,"With the start of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data technologies are attracting global attention. AI can achieve fast computational speed, and big data makes it possible to store and use vast amounts of data. In addition, smartphones, which are IoT devices, are owned by most people. Based on these advantages, the above three technologies can be combined and effectively applied to navigation technology. In the case of an outdoor environment, global positioning system (GPS) technology has been developed to enable relatively accurate positioning of the user. However, due to the problem of radio wave loss because of many obstacles and walls, there are obvious limitations in applying GPS to indoor environments. Hence, we propose a method to increase the accuracy of user positioning in indoor environments using wireless-fidelity (Wi-Fi). The core technology of the proposed method is to limit the initial search region of the particle swarm optimization (PSO), an intelligent particle algorithm; doing so increases the probability that particles converge to the global optimum and shortens the convergence time of the algorithm. For this reason, the proposed method can achieve fast processing time and high accuracy. To limit the initial search region of the PSO, we first build an received signal strength indicator (RSSI) database for each sample point (SP) using a fingerprinting scheme. Then, a limited region is established through a fuzzy matching algorithm. Finally, the particles are ran-domly distributed within a limited region, and then the user’s location is positioned through a PSO. Simulation results confirm that the method proposed in this paper achieves the highest positioning accuracy, with an error of about 1 m when the SP interval is 3 m in an indoor environment. © 2021 by the authors.

combining lightweight wheat spikes detecting model and offline android software development for in-field wheat yield prediction [结合轻量级麦穗检测模型和离线android软件开发的田间小麦测产],2021.0,0.0,"The number of spikes per unit area is a key yield component for cereal crops such as wheat, which is popularly used in wheat research for crop improvement. With the fast maturity of smartphone imaging hardware and recent advances in image processing and lightweight deep learning techniques, it is possible to acquire high-resolution images using a smartphone camera, followed by the analysis of wheat spikes per unit area through pre-trained artificial intelligence algorithms. Then, by combining detected spike number with variety-based spikelet number and grain weight, it is feasible to carry out a near real-time estimation of yield potential for a given wheat variety in the field. This AI-driven approach becomes more powerful when a range of varieties are included in the training datasets, enabling an effective and valuable approach for yield-related studies in breeding, cultivation, and agricultural production. In this study, we present a novel smartphone-based software application that combines smartphone imaging, lightweight and embedded deep learning, with yield prediction algorithms and applied the software to wheat cultivation experiments. This open-source Android application is called YieldQuant-Mobile (YQ-M), which was developed to measure a key yield trait (i.e. spikes per unit area) and then estimate yield based on the trait. Through YQ-M and smartphones, we standardized the in-field imaging of wheat plots, streamlined the detection of spikes per unit area and the prediction of yield, without a prerequisite of in-field WiFi or mobile network. In this article, we introduce the YQ-M in detail, including: 1) the data acquisition designed to standardize the collection of wheat images from an overhead perspective using Android smartphones; 2) the data pre-processing of the acquired image to reduce the computational time for image analysis; 3) the extraction of wheat spike features through deep learning (i.e. YOLOV4) and transfer learning; 4) the application of TensorFlow.lite to transform the trained model into a lightweight MobileNetV2-YOLOV4 model, so that wheat spike detection can be operated on an Android smartphone; 5) finally, the establishment of a mobile phone database to incorporate historic datasets of key yield components collected from different wheat varieties into YQ-M using Android SDK and SQLite. Additionally, to ensure that our work could reach the broader research community, we developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for YQ-M, which contains: 1) the spike detection module that identifies the number of wheat spikes from a smartphone image; 2) the yield prediction module that invokes near real-time yield prediction using detected spike numbers and related parameters such as wheat varieties, place of production, accumulated temperature, and unit area. During our research, we have tested YQ-M with 80 representative varieties (240 one-square-meter plots, three replicates) selected from the main wheat producing areas in China. The computed accuracy, recall, average accuracy, and F1-score for the learning model are 84.43%, 91.05%, 91.96%, and 0.88, respectively. The coefficient of determination between YQ-M predicted yield values and post-harvest manual yield measurement is 0.839 (n=80 varieties, P&lt;0.05; Root Mean Square Error=17.641 g/m2). The results suggest that YQ-M presented here has a high accuracy in the detection of wheat spikes per unit area and can produce a consistent yield prediction for the selected wheat varieties under complex field conditions. Furthermore, YQ-M can be easily accessed and expanded to incorporate new varieties and crop species, indicating the usability and extendibility of the software application. Hence, we believe that YQ-M is likely to provide a step change in our abilities to analyze yield-related components for different wheat varieties, a low-cost, accessible, and reliable approach that can contribute to smart breeding, cultivation and, potentially, agricultural production. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

fingerprint positioning method for dual-band wi-fi based on gaussian process regression and k-nearest neighbor,2021.0,1.0,"Since many Wi-Fi routers can currently transmit two-band signals, we aimed to study dual-band Wi-Fi to achieve better positioning results. Thus, this paper proposes a fingerprint positioning method for dual-band Wi-Fi based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) and the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. In the offline stage, the received signal strength (RSS) measurements of the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz signals at the reference points (RPs) are collected and normalized to generate the online dual-band fingerprint, a special fingerprint for dual-band Wi-Fi. Then, a dual-band fingerprint database, which is a dedicated fingerprint database for dual-band Wi-Fi, is built with the dual-band fingerprint and the corresponding RP coordinates. Each dual-band fingerprint constructs its positioning model with the GPR algorithm based on itself and its neighborhood fingerprints, and its corresponding RP coordinates are the label of this model. The neighborhood fingerprints are found by the spatial distances between RPs. In the online stage, the measured RSS values of dual-band Wi-Fi are used to generate the online dual-band fingerprint and the 5 GHz fingerprint. Due to the better stability of the 5 GHz signal, an initial position is solved with the 5 GHz fingerprint and the KNN algorithm. Then, the distances between the initial position and model labels are calculated to find a positioning model with the minimum distance, which is the optimal positioning model. Finally, the dual-band fingerprint is input into this model, and the output of this model is the final estimated position. To evaluate the proposed method, we selected two scenarios (A and B) as the test area. In scenario A, the mean error (ME) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed method were 1.067 and 1.331 m, respectively. The ME and RMSE in scenario B were 1.432 and 1.712 m, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a better positioning effect compared with the KNN, Rank, Coverage-area, and GPR algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

wifi fingerprinting indoor localization based on dynamic mode decomposition feature selection with hidden markov model,2021.0,0.0,"Over the years, WiFi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements have been widely implemented for determining the location of a user’s position in an indoor environment, where the GPS signal might not be received. This method utilizes a huge RSSI dataset collected from numerous access points (APs). The WiFi RSSI measurements are nonlinear with distance and are largely influenced by interference in the indoor environment. Therefore, machine learning (ML) techniques such as a hidden Markov model (HMM) are generally utilized to efficiently identify a trend of RSSI values, which corresponds to locations around a region of interest. Similar to other ML tools, the performance and computing cost of the HMM are dependent on the feature dimension since a large quantity of RSSI measurements are required for the learning process. Hence, this article introduces a feature extraction method based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for the HMM to effectively model WiFi fingerprint indoor localization. The DMD is adopted since it decomposes RSSIs to meaningful spatial and temporal forms over a given time. Here, the mode forms are analytically reconstructed to produce low-dimensional feature vectors, which are used with the HMM. The localization performance of the proposed HMM-DMD is compared with other well-known ML algorithms for WiFi fingerprinting localization using simulations. The results show that the HMM-DMD algorithm yields a significant localization performance improvement, accuracy, and reasonable processing time in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

The starting position and the goal position of the WMR in an outdoor environment are given by the GNSS RTK positioning system. Real‐time position correction of the robot is performed through the differential global positioning system. The robot system applies the ant algorithm and the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path for patrol tasks. The convolutional neural network image processing is utilized to identify intruders that are appearing in the patrol path. When the WMR detects an intruder by the face detection and recognition methods, the robot captures the photo of this person by the webcam and acquires the location information of this person by the RTK positioning system.

sage: a split-architecture methodology for efficient end-to-end autonomous vehicle control,2021.0,0.0,"Autonomous vehicles (AV) are expected to revolutionize transportation and improve road safety significantly. However, these benefits do not come without cost; AVs require large Deep-Learning (DL) models and powerful hardware platforms to operate reliably in real-time, requiring between several hundred watts to one kilowatt of power. This power consumption can dramatically reduce vehicles' driving range and affect emissions. To address this problem, we propose SAGE: a methodology for selectively offloading the key energy-consuming modules of DL architectures to the cloud to optimize edge, energy usage while meeting real-time latency constraints. Furthermore, we leverage Head Network Distillation (HND) to introduce efficient bottlenecks within the DL architecture in order to minimize the network overhead costs of offloading with almost no degradation in the model's performance. We evaluate SAGE using an Nvidia Jetson TX2 and an industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 as the AV edge, devices and demonstrate that our offloading strategy is practical for a wide range of DL models and internet connection bandwidths on 3G, 4G LTE, and WiFi technologies. Compared to edge-only computation, SAGE reduces energy consumption by an average of 36.13%, 47.07%, and 55.66% for an AV with one low-resolution camera, one high-resolution camera, and three high-resolution cameras, respectively. SAGE also reduces upload data size by up to 98.40% compared to direct camera offloading. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",autonomous vehicles; computation offloading; deep learning; edge computing; Energy optimization,"Malawade A., Odema M., Lajeunesse-Degroot S., Al Faruque M.A.",Conference Paper,sage split architecture methodology efficient end end autonomous vehicle control autonomous vehicle av expect revolutionize transportation improve road safety significantly benefit come cost avs require large deep dl model powerful hardware platform operate reliably real time require watt kilowatt power power consumption dramatically reduce vehicle driving range affect emission address problem sage methodology selectively offload key energy consume module dl architecture cloud optimize edge energy usage meet real time latency constraint furthermore leverage head distillation hnd introduce efficient bottleneck dl architecture order minimize overhead cost offload degradation model evaluate sage nvidia jetson tx2 industry standard nvidia drive px2 av edge device demonstrate offloading strategy practical wide range dl model internet connection bandwidth g g lte technology compare edge computation sage reduce energy consumption average 36.13 47.07 55.66 av low resolution camera high resolution camera high resolution camera respectively sage reduce upload size 98.40 compare direct camera offloading association compute machinery autonomous vehicle computation offloading deep edge computing energy optimization
ai-aided individual emergency detection system in edge-internet of things environments,2021.0,0.0,"Recently, many disasters have occurred in indoor places. In order to rescue or detect victims within disaster scenes, vital information regarding their existence and location is needed. To provide such information, some studies simply employ indoor positioning systems to identify each mobile device of victims. However, their schemes may be unreliable, since people sometimes drop their mobile devices or put them on a desk. In other words, their methods may find a mobile device, not a victim. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel individual monitoring system based on edge intelligence. The proposed system monitors coexisting states with a user and a smart mobile device through a user state detection mechanism, which could allow tracking through the monitoring of continuous user state switching. Then, a fine-grained localization scheme is employed to perceive the precise location of a user who is with a mobile device. Hence, the proposed system is developed as a proof-of-concept relying on off-the-shelf WiFi devices and reusing pervasive signals. The smart mobile devices of users interact with hierarchical edge computing resources to quickly and safely collect and manage sensing data of user behaviors with encryption by cipher-block chaining, and user behaviors are analyzed via the ensemble paradigm of three machine learning technologies.

iq-data-based wifi signal classification algorithm using the choi-williams and margenau-hill-spectrogram features: a case in human activity recognition,2021.0,0.0,"This paper presents a novel approach that applies WiFi-based IQ data and time–frequency images to classify human activities automatically and accurately. The proposed strategy first uses the Choi–Williams distribution transform and the Margenau–Hill spectrogram transform to obtain the time–frequency images, followed by the offset and principal component analysis (PCA) feature extraction. The offset features were extracted from the IQ data and several spectra with maximum energy values in the time domain, and the PCA features were extracted via the whole images and several image slices on them with rich unit information. Finally, a traditional supervised learning classifier was used to label various activities. With twelve-thousand experimental samples from four categories of WiFi signals, the experimental data validated our proposed method. The results showed that our method was more robust to varying image slices or PCA numbers over the measured dataset.

human activity recognition using csi information with nexmon,2021.0,0.0,"Using Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 standard, radio frequency waves are mainly used for communication on various devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and smart televisions. Apart from communication applications, the recent research in wireless technology has turned Wi-Fi into other exploration possibilities such as human activity recognition (HAR). HAR is a field of study that aims to predict motion and movement made by a person or even several people. There are numerous possibilities to use the Wi-Fi-based HAR solution for human-centric applications in intelligent surveil-lance, such as human fall detection in the health care sector or for elderly people nursing homes, smart homes for temperature control, a light control application, and motion detection applications. This paper’s focal point is to classify human activities such as EMPTY, LYING, SIT, SIT-DOWN, STAND, STAND-UP, WALK, and FALL with deep neural networks, such as long-term short memory (LSTM) and support vector machines (SVM). Special care was taken to address practical issues such as using available commodity hardware. Therefore, the open-source tool Nexmon was used for the channel state information (CSI) extraction on inexpensive hardware (Raspberry Pi 3B+, Pi 4B, and Asus RT-AC86U routers). We conducted three different types of experiments using different algorithms, which all demonstrated a similar accuracy in prediction for HAR with an accuracy between 97% and 99.7% (Raspberry Pi) and 96.2% and 100% (Asus RT-AC86U), for the best models, which is superior to previously published results.

a csi-based indoor positioning system using single uwb ranging correction,2021.0,0.0,"A fingerprint-based localization system is an economic way to solve an indoor positioning problem. However, the traditional off-line fingerprint collection stage is a time-consuming and laborious process which limits the use of fingerprint-based localization systems. In this paper, based on ubiquitous Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) equipment and a low-cost Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging system (with only one UWB anchor), a ready-to-use indoor localization system is proposed to realize long-term and high-accuracy indoor positioning. More specifically, in this system, it is divided into two stages: (1) an initial stage, and (2) a positioning stage. In the initial stage, an Inertial Measure Unit (IMU) is used to calculate the position using Pedestrian Dead Reckon (PDR) algorithm within a preset number of steps, and the location-related fingerprints are collected to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression model; simultaneously, in order to make the UWB ranging system adapt to the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environment, the increments of acceleration and angular velocity in IMU and the increments of single UWB ranging measures are correlated to pre-train a Supported Vector Regression (SVR). After reaching the threshold of time or step number, the system is changed into a positioning stage, and the CNN predicts the position calibrated by corrected UWB ranging. At last, a series of practical experiments are conducted in the real environment; the experiment results show that, due to the corrected UWB ranging measures calibrating the CNN parameters in every positioning period, this system has stable localization results in a comparative long-term range. Additionally, it has the advantages of stability, low cost, anti-noise, etc. © 2021 by the authors.

arsenal: understanding learning-based wireless video transport via in-depth evaluation,2021.0,0.0,"Recent years have witnessed a rise of learning-based (i.e., artificial intelligence driven or AI-driven) video transport design, in order to achieve consistently high performance, even when the modern Internet is becoming increasingly heterogeneous while the applications are becoming unprecedentedly demanding (i.e., the simultaneous high-throughput and low-latency requirements of HD video telephony or intelligent remote driving). While separate evaluation using proprietary platform has shown the advantage of AI-driven algorithms over their non-AI counterparts, a systematic study is missing for directly comparing these AI-driven design under a uniform and practical platform. To bridge the gap, in this work, we first design and implement a full-fledged evaluation platform named Arsenal, which incorporates multiple state-of-the-art congestion control algorithms, most of which are AI-driven. Using Arsenal, we carry out a thorough comparative study of the algorithms, over massive traces collected from heterogeneous networks including WiFi, 4G, 3G and even the rare commercial 5G wireless networks.

use of machine learning for the estimation of down- and up-link field exposure in multi-source indoor wifi scenarios,2021.0,0.0,"A novel Machine Learning (ML) method based on Neural Networks (NN) is proposed to assess radio-frequency (RF) exposure generated by WiFi sources in indoor scenarios. The aim was to build an NN capable of addressing the complexity and variability of real-life exposure setups, including the effects of not only down-link transmission access points (APs) but also up-link transmission by different sources (e.g. laptop, printers, tablets, and smartphones). The NN was fed with easy to be found data, such as the position and type of WiFi sources (APs, clients, and other users) and the position and material characteristics (e.g. penetration loss) of walls. The NN model was assessed using an additional new layout, distinct from that one used to build and optimize the NN coefficients. The NN model achieved a remarkable field prediction accuracy across exposure conditions in both layouts, with a median prediction error of −0.4 to 0.6 dB and a root mean square error of 2.5−5.1 dB, compared with the target electric field estimated by a deterministic indoor network planner. The proposed approach performs well for the different layouts and is thus generally used to assess RF exposure in indoor scenarios. © 2021 The Authors.

multimedia traffic classification with mixture of markov components,2021.0,0.0,"We study multimedia traffic classification into popular applications to assist the quality of service (QoS) support of networking technologies, including but not limited to, WiFi. For this purpose, we propose to model the multimedia traffic flow as a stochastic discrete-time Markov chain in order to take into account the strong sequentiality (i.e. the dependencies across the data instances) in the traffic flow observations. This addresses the shortcoming of the prior techniques that are based on feature extraction which is prone to losing the information of sequentiality. Also, for investigating the best application of our Markov approach to traffic classification, we introduce and test three data driven classification schemes which are all derived from the proposed model and tightly related to each other. Our first classifier has a global perspective of the traffic data via the likelihood function as a mixture of Markov components (MMC). Our second and third classifiers have local perspective based on k-nearest Markov components (kNMC) with the negative loglikelihood as a distance as well as k-nearest Markov parameters (kNMP) with the Euclidean distance. We additionally introduce to the use of researchers a rich multimedia traffic dataset consisting of four application categories, e.g., video on demand, with seven applications, e.g., YouTube. In the presented comprehensive experiments with the introduced dataset, our local Markovian approach kNMC outperforms MMC and kNMP and provides excellent classification performance, 89% accuracy at the category level and 85% accuracy at the application level and particularly over 95% accuracy for live video streaming. Thus, in test time, the nearest Markov components with the largest likelihoods yield the most discrimination power. We also observe that kNMC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (such as SVM, random forest and autoencoder) on both the introduced dataset and benchmark dataset both at the category and application levels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Machine learning; Markov models; Multimedia; Traffic classification; WiFi; Wireless last-hop,"Ozkan H., Temelli R., Gurbuz O., Koksal O.K., Ipekoren A.K., Canbal F., Karahan B.D., Kuran M.Ş.",Article,multimedia traffic classification mixture markov component multimedia traffic classification popular application assist quality service qos support networking technology include limit purpose model multimedia traffic flow stochastic discrete time markov chain order account strong sequentiality i.e. dependency instance traffic flow observation address shortcoming prior technique base feature extraction prone lose information sequentiality investigate good application markov approach traffic classification introduce test drive classification scheme derive propose model tightly related classifier global perspective traffic likelihood function mixture markov component mmc second classifier local perspective base k near markov component knmc negative loglikelihood distance k nearest markov parameter knmp euclidean distance additionally introduce use researcher rich multimedia traffic dataset consist application category e.g. video demand seven application e.g. youtube present comprehensive experiment introduce dataset local markovian approach knmc outperform mmc knmp provide excellent classification accuracy category level accuracy application level particularly accuracy live video streaming test time near markov component large likelihood yield discrimination power observe knmc significantly outperform state art method svm random forest autoencod introduce dataset benchmark dataset category application level elsevi b.v machine markov model multimedia traffic classification hop
adaptive genetic algorithm-aided neural network with channel state information tensor decomposition for indoor localization,2021.0,24.0,"Channel state information (CSI) can provide phase and amplitude of multichannel subcarrier to better describe signal propagation characteristics. Therefore, CSI has become one of the most commonly used features in indoor Wi-Fi localization. In addition, compared to the CSI geometric localization method, the CSI fingerprint localization method has the advantages of easy implementation and high accuracy. However, as the scale of the fingerprint database increases, the training cost and processing complexity of CSI fingerprints will also greatly increase. Based on this, this article proposes to combine backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) with CSI tensor decomposition for indoor Wi-Fi fingerprint localization. Specifically, the tensor decomposition algorithm based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis model and the alternate least squares (ALSs) iterative algorithm are combined to reduce the interference of the environment. Then, we use the tensor wavelet decomposition algorithm for feature extraction and obtain the CSI fingerprint. Finally, in order to find the optimal weights and thresholds and then obtain the estimated location coordinates, we introduce an AGA to optimize BPNN. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high localization accuracy, while improving the data processing ability and fitting the nonlinear relationship between CSI location fingerprints and location coordinates. © 1997-2012 IEEE.",Channel state information (CSI); fingerprint localization; genetic algorithm; neural network; tensor decomposition,"Zhou M., Long Y., Zhang W., Pu Q., Wang Y., Nie W., He W.",Article,adaptive genetic algorithm aid neural channel state information tensor decomposition indoor localization channel state information csi provide phase amplitude multichannel subcarrier well describe signal propagation characteristic csi commonly feature indoor localization addition compare csi geometric localization csi fingerprint localization advantage easy implementation high accuracy scale fingerprint database increase training cost processing complexity csi fingerprint greatly increase base article propose combine backpropagation neural bpnn adaptive genetic algorithm aga csi tensor decomposition indoor fingerprint localization specifically tensor decomposition algorithm base parallel factor parafac model alternate square alss iterative algorithm combine reduce interference environment use tensor wavelet decomposition algorithm feature extraction obtain csi fingerprint finally order find optimal weight threshold obtain estimate location coordinate introduce aga optimize bpnn experimental result propose algorithm high localization accuracy improve processing ability fit nonlinear relationship csi location fingerprint location coordinate channel state information csi fingerprint localization genetic algorithm neural tensor decomposition
maximum convergence algorithm for wifi based indoor positioning system,2021.0,0.0,"WiFi-based indoor positioning is widely exploited thanks to the existing WiFi infrastructure in buildings and built-in sensors in smartphones. The techniques for indoor positioning require the high-density training data to archive high accuracy with high computation complexity.

Also, the K-mean clustering is deployed for each access point to reduce the computation complexity of the offline databases. Moreover, the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) method and Kalman filter with the information from the received signal strength (RSS) and inertial sensors are applied to the WiFi fingerprinting to increase the efficiency of the mobile object's position. The different experiments are performed to compare the proposed algorithm with the others using KNN and PDR. The recommended framework demonstrates significant proceed based on the results.

deep learning-guided jamming for cross-technology wireless networks: attack and defense,2021.0,0.0,"Wireless networks of different technologies may interfere with each other when they are deployed at proximity. Such cross-technology interference (CTI) has become prevalent with the surge of IoT devices. In this paper, we exploit CTI in coexisting WiFi-Zigbee networks and propose DeepJam, a new stealthy jamming strategy, to jam Zigbee traffic. DeepJam relies on deep learning techniques to capture the temporal pattern of the past wireless traffic and predict the future wireless traffic. By only jamming the victim's transmissions that are not disrupted by CTI, DeepJam can significantly reduce the victim's throughput with far fewer jamming signals and is thus much more stealthy than conventional jamming strategies. Detailed evaluations show that DeepJam can converge within 10 sec and achieve the jamming-efficiency gains of up to 742% and 285% over conventional random and reactive jamming strategies, respectively, in practical scenarios. We also propose a simple yet effective countermeasure against DeepJam. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",cross-technology interference; Jamming; reinforcement learning; WiFi and Zigbee,"Han D., Li A., Zhang L., Zhang Y., Li J., Li T., Zhu T., Zhang Y.",Article,deep guide jamming cross technology attack defense different technology interfere deploy proximity cross technology interference cti prevalent surge iot device exploit cti coexist zigbee deepjam new stealthy jamming strategy jam zigbee traffic deepjam rely deep technique capture temporal pattern past traffic predict future traffic jam victim transmission disrupt cti deepjam significantly reduce victim throughput far few jamming signal stealthy conventional jamming strategy detailed evaluation deepjam converge sec achieve jamming efficiency gain conventional random reactive jamming strategy respectively practical scenario simple effective countermeasure deepjam cross technology interference jamming reinforcement zigbee

To improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) on the unlicensed bands and fit its distributed structure while ensuring the fairness among D2D-U links and the harmonious coexistence with WiFi networks, a distributed joint power and spectrum scheme is proposed. In particular, a parameter, named as price, is defined, which is updated at each D2D-U pair by a online trained Neural network (NN) according to the channel state and traffic load. In addition, the parameters used in the NN are updated by two ways, unsupervised self-iteration and federated learning, to guarantee the fairness and harmonious coexistence. Then, a non-convex optimization problem with respect to the spectrum and power is formulated and solved on each D2D-U link to maximize its own data rate.

apfnet: amplitude-phase fusion network for csi-based action recognition,2021.0,0.0,"Traditional Wi-Fi based action recognition models often utilize only amplitude information from CSI, with phase information simply discarded due to phase error problems. Such a design decision inevitably limits the information utilization, thus the overall performance. These models also strive at high recognition accuracy, invoking complicated model designs with high computational complexity, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained applications or swift migration. To address these issues, a novel lightweight action recognition model based on amplitude-phase fusion is proposed in this paper. To achieve maximum fusion benefit, the phase error is first corrected before information extraction. A lightweight multi-data fusion network termed APFNet is then designed and applied to fuse amplitude and phase information before extracting features for action recognition. Extensive experiments confirmed that comparing to schemes utilizing only amplitude information, APFNet can not only adapt to data with a low sampling frequency (30 Hz) but also significantly reduce the computational complexity, while maintaining a high recognition accuracy (96.7%). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Action recognition; Amplitude-phase fusion; Convolutional neural network; Wi-fi perception,"Duan P., Li H., Zhang B., Cao Y., Wang E.",Article,apfnet amplitude phase fusion csi base action recognition traditional base action recognition model utilize amplitude information csi phase information simply discard phase error problem design decision inevitably limit information utilization overall model strive high recognition accuracy invoke complicated model design high computational complexity render unsuitable resource constrain application swift migration address issue novel lightweight action recognition model base amplitude phase fusion propose achieve maximum fusion benefit phase error correct information extraction lightweight multi fusion term apfnet design apply fuse amplitude phase information extract feature action recognition extensive experiment confirm compare scheme utilize amplitude information apfnet adapt low sampling frequency   hz significantly reduce computational complexity maintain high recognition accuracy 96.7 author(s exclusive licence springer science+business medium llc springer nature action recognition amplitude phase fusion convolutional neural perception

applications of information channels to physics-informed neural networks for wifi signal propagation simulation at the edge of the industrial internet of things,2021.0,0.0,"The ubiquitous presence of data driven technologies that move information from the edge of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to the cloud for advanced computation and back to the edge for action are pushing wireless connections to the limit. Under these conditions optimizing WIFI Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI) can improve data management, computational workflows, and geolocation accuracy while reducing energy consumption in order to minimize charging and computational resource requirements at the edge. Ensuring connectivity for these mission critical processes will require detailed knowledge (either measured or simulated) of the state of the electromagnetic fields in advanced manufacturing scenarios. Simulation has the advantage of developing more scalable solutions to this characterization problem but comes at a very high computational cost that may not be possible on edge devices with limited computational resources. In order to reduce the time and resource cost of achieving real time simulations with low computing specification edge devices, we propose creating a novel method that exploits the notion of information channels to create efficient Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) capable of determining the RSSI given a completely new geometry (never used in training) where objects or obstacles (walls, machines, tables, etc.) and their respective location, size and reflectivity indices, along with the antenna location are completely random. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs); Geometrical Optics (GO); Internet of Things; Shannon entropy; WiFi Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI),"Olivares E., Ye H., Herrero A., Nia B.A., Ren Y., Donovan R.P., Flaviis F., de",Article,application information channel physics inform neural signal propagation simulation edge industrial internet thing ubiquitous presence drive technology information edge industrial internet thing iiot cloud advanced computation edge action push connection limit condition optimize receive signal strength intensity rssi improve management computational workflow geolocation accuracy reduce energy consumption order minimize charge computational resource requirement edge ensure connectivity mission critical process require detailed knowledge measure simulate state electromagnetic field advanced manufacture scenario simulation advantage develop scalable solution characterization problem come high computational cost possible edge device limited computational resource order reduce time resource cost achieve real time simulation low compute specification edge device create novel exploit notion information channel create efficient convolutional neural cnns capable determine rssi give completely new geometry training object obstacle wall machine table etc respective location size reflectivity index antenna location completely random elsevi b.v convolutional neural cnn geometrical optic internet thing shannon entropy receive signal strength intensity rssi

The challenge evaluates the recognition performance by comparing predicted to ground-Truth labels at every second, but puts no constraints on the maximum decision window length. Overall, two submissions achieved F1 scores between 70% and 80%, one between 60% and 70%, five between 50% and 60%, and seven below 50%. Due to the technical challenges of data synchronization, sensor unavailability and sensor diversity, the overall performance based on GPS and radio sensors is lower than the performance achieved by motion sensors in previous challenges (SHL 2018-2020).

device-free pedestrian count estimation using wi-fi channel state information,2021.0,0.0,"Dynamic adjustment of signal timing based on the number of pedestrians waiting at a crossing results in safer and more efficient intersections. Traditionally, such information is obtained through push-buttons or vision-based techniques. Though counting is possible with the latter, the techniques are associated with privacy concerns, are affected by poor lighting, and equipment is costly and bulky. We present a novel alternative that uses Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) processed through a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. The amplitude and phase of 51 Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing sub carriers in the IEEE802.11n standard are captured with two ESP32 devices. Of the candidate DNNs trained with the CSI data, a ID-Convolutional Neural Network is experimentally demonstrated to count up to 12 pedestrians with an accuracy of 79 % at the current level of training. This can be generalized to perform robustly across different environments, and having a footprint of 1.2MB, can be implemented on a Raspberry Pi 4 device. Our contributions include the use of 51 subcarriers, successful outdoor performance, and implementation on low-cost COTS components.

A new dataset covering a residential area of 30975 m2with 25 positions was collected on three different days, several weeks apart with three different devices. The area also showed different coverages of WiFi Access Points. Four different architectures were tested: firstly, a classic four layer DNN and a CNN based on ResNet bottleneck units. Then two sequence oriented NN's: an RNN and an LSTM. Results indicate that all the architectures are able to perform reasonably well on the localisation task being the LSTM one obtaining the best results with 93.26% accuracy and a mean distance error of 1.62m.

wifi-sleep: sleep stage monitoring using commodity wi-fi devices,2021.0,1.0,"Sleep monitoring is essential to people's health and wellbeing, which can also assist in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorder. Compared with contact-based solutions, contactless sleep monitoring does not attach any device to the human body; hence, it has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Inspired by the recent advances in Wi-Fi-based sensing, this article proposes a low-cost and nonintrusive sleep monitoring system using commodity Wi-Fi devices, namely, WiFi-Sleep. We leverage the fine-grained channel state information from multiple antennas and propose advanced fusion and signal processing methods to extract accurate respiration and body movement information. We introduce a deep learning method combined with clinical sleep medicine prior knowledge to achieve four-stage sleep monitoring with limited data sources (i.e., only respiration and body movement information). We benchmark the performance of WiFi-Sleep with polysomnography, the gold reference standard. Results show that WiFi-Sleep achieves an accuracy of 81.8%, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art sleep stage monitoring using expensive radar devices. © 2014 IEEE.",Channel state information (CSI); sleep monitoring; Wi-Fi,"Yu B., Wang Y., Niu K., Zeng Y., Gu T., Wang L., Guan C., Zhang D.",Article,sleep sleep stage monitor commodity device sleep monitoring essential people health wellbeing assist diagnosis treatment sleep disorder compare contact base solution contactless sleep monitoring attach device human body attract increase attention recent year inspire recent advance base sensing article propose low cost nonintrusive sleep monitoring commodity device sleep leverage fine grain channel state information multiple antenna advanced fusion signal processing method extract accurate respiration body movement information introduce deep combine clinical sleep medicine prior knowledge achieve stage sleep monitoring limited source i.e. respiration body movement information benchmark sleep polysomnography gold reference standard result sleep achieve accuracy 81.8 comparable state art sleep stage monitor expensive radar device channel state information csi sleep monitoring
semi-supervised learning framework for uav detection,2021.0,0.0,"The use of supervised learning with various sensing techniques such as audio, visual imaging, thermal sensing, RADAR, and radio frequency (RF) have been widely applied in the detection of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in an environment. However, little or no attention has been given to the application of unsupervised or semi-supervised algorithms for UAV detection. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised technique and architecture for detecting UAVs in an environment by exploiting the RF signals (i.e., fingerprints) between a UAV and its flight-controller communication under wireless inference such as Bluetooth and WiFi. By decomposing the RF signals using a two-level wavelet packet transform, we estimated the second moment statistic (i.e., variance) of the coefficients in each packet as a feature set. We developed a local outlier factor model as the UAV detection algorithm using the coefficient variances of the wavelet packets from WiFi and Bluetooth signals. When detecting the presence of RF-based UAV, we achieved an accuracy of 96.7% and 86% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB and 18 dB, respectively. The application of this approach is not limited to UAV detection as it can be extended to the detection of rogue RF devices in an environment. © 2021 IEEE.",detection; local outlier factor; RF fingerprinting; UAV; wavelet packet transform,"Medaiyese O.O., Ezuma M., Lauf A.P., Guvenc I.",Conference Paper,semi supervised framework uav detection use supervised sensing technique audio visual imaging thermal sensing radar radio frequency rf widely apply detection unmanned aerial vehicle uav environment little attention give application unsupervised semi supervised algorithm uav detection semi supervised architecture detect uavs environment exploit rf signal i.e. fingerprint uav flight controller communication inference bluetooth decompose rf signal level wavelet packet transform estimate second moment statistic i.e. variance coefficient packet feature set develop local outlier factor model uav detection algorithm coefficient variance wavelet packet bluetooth signal detect presence rf base uav achieve accuracy 96.7 signal noise ratio db db respectively application approach limit uav detection extend detection rogue rf device environment detection local outlier factor rf fingerprinting uav wavelet packet transform
low-effort deep learning method trained through virtual trajectories for indoor tracking,2021.0,0.0,"We develop a novel low-effort Wi-Fi fingerprinting method to generate a fully labeled dataset of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values to train a deep learning model for indoor localization and trajectory estimation. The positioning accuracy of Wi-Fi fingerprinting approach can be improved by collecting large amount of labeled data with diverse set of hardware devices, orientation angles, and environmental conditions. However, the cost of data collection becomes prohibitive. In crowdsourcing method, volunteers who frequently visit the indoor space, contribute unlabeled but diverse trajectories. However, despite the potential to collect large quantities of data, unlabeled trajectories produce large positioning errors. In this paper, we propose a novel method where we only collect a base-fingerprinting set with a limited number of devices, orientation angles, and environmental conditions. Then, we develop RSSI model which allows us to simulate device orientation angle and environmental conditions diversity as noises that are added on top of RSSI values in the base-fingerprinting set. We then generate a very large set of fully labeled diverse virtual trajectories to train appropriate deep learning models for use in the online-phase of Wi-Fi fingerprinting method. In this paper, we train 1-D convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) models called base- and diverse-models. Base-model is trained on the virtual trajectories obtained exclusively from the base-fingerprinting set. On the other hand, diverse-model is trained on the so-called noisy trajectories which are created with the help of RSSI model. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform experiments in our campus library. When the online-phase trajectory is coming from hardware orientation angles and environmental conditions not used for data collection, the diverse-model achieves an average mean square error of 1.24m as compared to 19.25m for the base-model.

b5g: intelligent coexistence model for edge network,2021.0,0.0,"While researchers are focusing on the fifth-generation (5G) cellular network, the network operators and standard bodies are discussing specifications for beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and 6G. Attributes of B5G include edge intelligence which involves artificial intelligence or machine learning (ML) in the architecture. Network edge servers, or base stations (BS), use edge computing to make time-critical decisions, especially in IoT devices while the data are being transmitted into the cloud. As the dynamic spectrum sharing continues in B5G, BSs implements the coexistence between Wi-Fi and cellular network. These exciting advances require energy efficiency to be considered as network operators pay the majority of the expenses to energy consumption. In this paper, different prediction models on traffic behaviour are computed to determine the lowest root mean square error. The best prediction model is used in the wake-up policy to consider the communication and computing times of the BS needed to return in service. Furthermore, a wake-up policy for the BS is introduced to maintain Quality of Service (QoS) while minimizing energy consumption. Particularly, a wake-up time threshold is set so that if the duration of the traffic prediction time does not cross this threshold, the decision will not be in favour to put it into sleep mode. This ensures that the QoS of the user is not compromised, as this threshold removes the unnecessary wasted time for BS to go to sleep and wake-up. © 2021 IEEE.",BSG; Coexistence; IoT; Machine Learning,"Zimmo S., Refaey A., Shami A.",Conference Paper,b5 g intelligent coexistence model edge researcher focus fifth generation g cellular operator standard body discuss specification fifth generation b5 g g. attribute b5 g include edge intelligence involve artificial intelligence machine ml architecture edge server station bs use edge computing time critical decision especially iot device transmit cloud dynamic spectrum sharing continue b5 g bss implement coexistence cellular exciting advance require energy efficiency consider operator pay majority expense energy consumption different prediction model traffic behaviour compute determine low root mean square error good prediction model wake policy consider communication computing time bs need return service furthermore wake policy b introduce maintain quality service qos minimize energy consumption particularly wake time threshold set duration traffic prediction time cross threshold decision favour sleep mode ensure qos user compromise threshold remove unnecessary waste time b sleep wake bsg coexistence iot machine

a two-stage sem-artificial neural network analysis of mobile commerce and its drivers,2021.0,1.0,"The COVID-19 health and economic crisis has affected all areas of social life globally, including the economy. The world economy has declined due to purchasing power for individuals who have been forced to stay at home and cannot perform work. These restrictions to prevent the spread of SARS-Cov-2 have led to an increase in electronic commerce and mobile commerce as tools for procuring goods and services. In this paper, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of mobile commerce as an essential electronic commerce component, establishing the main drivers of mobile commerce and the intensity of their influences. The research focuses on mobile commerce in the United States (U.S.). It covers the period 2010-2020, the last year of this period capturing the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on electronic commerce (e-commerce) and mobile commerce (m-commerce). In the macroeconomic analysis of competitiveness, we established the main drivers of m-commerce, using artificial neural networks and the mediation effects found between the variables that describe m-commerce, e-commerce, and total sales, using structural equation modeling.

device-free human identification using behavior signatures in wifi sensing,2021.0,0.0,"Wireless sensing can be used for human identification by mining and quantifying individual behavior effects on wireless signal propagation. This work proposes a novel device-free biometric (DFB) system, WirelessID, that explores the joint human fine-grained behavior and body physical signatures embedded in channel state information (CSI) by extracting spatiotemporal features. In addition, the signal fluctuations corresponding to different parts of the body contribute differently to the identification performance. Inspired by the success of the attention mechanism in computer vision (CV), thus, to extract more robust features, we introduce the spatiotemporal attention function into our system. To evaluate the performance, commercial WiFi devices are used for prototyping WirelessID in a real laboratory environment with an average accuracy of 93.14% and a best accuracy of 97.72% for five individuals. © 2021 by the authors.

deep-learning-based wi-fi indoor positioning system using continuous csi of trajectories,2021.0,0.0,"In a Wi-Fi indoor positioning system (IPS), the performance of the IPS depends on the channel state information (CSI), which is often limited due to the multipath fading effect, especially in indoor environments involving multiple non-line-of-sight propagation paths. In this paper, we propose a novel IPS utilizing trajectory CSI observed from predetermined trajectories instead of the CSI collected at each stationary location; thus, the proposed method enables all the CSI along each route to be continuously encountered in the observation. Further, by using a generative adversarial network (GAN), which helps enlarge the training dataset, the cost of trajectory CSI collection can be significantly reduced. To fully exploit the trajectory CSI’s spatial and temporal information, the proposed IPS employs a deep learning network of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network–long short-term memory (1DCNN-LSTM). The proposed IPS was hardware-implemented, where digital signal processors and a universal software radio peripheral were used as a modem and radio frequency transceiver, respectively, for both access point and mobile device of Wi-Fi. We verified that the proposed IPS based on the trajectory CSI far outperforms the state-of-the-art IPS based on the CSI collected from stationary locations through extensive experimental tests and computer simulations. © 2021 by the authors.

an rss transform—based wknn for indoor positioning,2021.0,1.0,"An RSS transform–based weighted k-nearest neighbor (WKNN) indoor positioning algo-rithm, Q-WKNN, is proposed to improve the positioning accuracy and real-time performance of Wi-Fi fingerprint–based indoor positioning. To smooth the RSS fluctuation difference caused by acquisition equipment, time, and environment changes, base Q is introduced in Q-WKNN to transform RSS to Q-based RSS, based on the relationship between the received signal strength (RSS) and physical distance. Analysis of the effective range of base Q indicates that Q-WKNN is more suitable for regions with noticeable environmental changes and fixed access points (APs). To reduce the positioning time, APs are selected to form a Q-WKNN similarity matrix. Adaptive K is applied to estimate the test point (TP) position. Commonly used indoor positioning algorithms are compared to Q-WKNN on Zenodo and underground parking databases. Results show that Q-WKNN has better positioning accuracy and real-time performance than WKNN, modified-WKNN (M-WKNN), Gaussian kernel (GK), and least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

non-uniform time-step deep q-network for carrier-sense multiple access in heterogeneous wireless networks,2021.0,2.0,"This paper investigates a new class of carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols that employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques, referred to as carrier-sense deep-reinforcement learning multiple access (CS-DLMA). The goal of CS-DLMA is to enable efficient and equitable spectrum sharing among a group of co-located heterogeneous wireless networks. Existing CSMA protocols, such as the medium access control (MAC) protocol of WiFi, are designed for a homogeneous network in which all nodes adopt the same protocol. Such protocols suffer from severe performance degradation in a heterogeneous environment where there are nodes adopting other MAC protocols. CS-DLMA aims to circumvent this problem by making use of DRL. In particular, this paper adopts $\alpha$α-fairness as the general objective of CS-DLMA. With $\alpha$α-fairness, CS-DLMA can achieve a range of different objectives (e.g., maximizing sum throughput, achieving proportional fairness, or achieving max-min fairness) when coexisting with other MACs by changing the value of $\alpha$α. A salient feature of CS-DLMA is that it can achieve these objectives without knowing the coexisting MACs through a learning process based on DRL. The underpinning DRL technique in CS-DLMA is deep Q-network (DQN). However, the conventional DQN algorithms are not suitable for CS-DLMA due to their uniform time-step assumption. In CSMA protocols, time steps are non-uniform in that the time duration required for carrier sensing is smaller than the duration of data transmission. This paper introduces a non-uniform time-step formulation of DQN to address this issue. Our simulation results show that CS-DLMA can achieve the general $\alpha$α-fairness objective when coexisting with TDMA, ALOHA, and WiFi protocols by adjusting its own transmission strategy. Interestingly, we also find that CS-DLMA is more Pareto efficient than other CSMA protocols, e.g., p-persistent CSMA, when coexisting with WiFi. Although this paper focuses on the use of our non-uniform time-step DQN formulation in wireless networking, we believe this new DQN formulation can also find use in other domains. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",Deep reinforcement learning; Heterogeneous wireless networks; Medium access control (MAC); α-fairness,"Yu Y., Liew S.C., Wang T.",Article,non uniform time step deep q carrier sense multiple access heterogeneous investigate new class carrier sense multiple access csma protocol employ deep reinforcement drl technique refer carrier sense deep reinforcement multiple access cs dlma goal cs dlma enable efficient equitable spectrum sharing group co locate heterogeneous exist csma protocol medium access control mac protocol design homogeneous node adopt protocol protocol suffer severe degradation heterogeneous environment node adopt mac protocol cs dlma aim circumvent problem make use drl particular adopt $ \alpha$α fairness general objective cs dlma $ \alpha$α fairness cs dlma achieve range different objective e.g. maximize sum throughput achieve proportional fairness achieve max min fairness coexist mac change value $ \alpha$α salient feature cs dlma achieve objective know coexist mac process base drl underpinning drl cs dlma deep q dqn conventional dqn algorithm suitable cs dlma uniform time step assumption csma protocol time step non uniform time duration require carrier sensing small duration transmission introduce non uniform time step formulation dqn address issue simulation result cs dlma achieve general $ \alpha$α fairness objective coexist tdma aloha protocol adjust transmission strategy interestingly find cs dlma pareto efficient csma protocol e.g. p persistent csma coexist focus use non uniform time step dqn formulation networking believe new dqn formulation find use domain deep reinforcement heterogeneous medium access control mac α fairness
epidemic contact tracing with campus wifi network and smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning,2021.0,1.0,"Due to the rapid spreading of infectious disease COVID-19, numerous campus students are increasingly exposed to the dilemma and thus the provisioning of a safe environment becomes of vital importance. As a well-established approach, contact tracing could contain epidemic diseases spread. Since WiFi network could cover almost the whole campus and each student carries at least one WiFi capable device (i.e., smartphone), in this work, an epidemic contact tracing with campus WiFi network and smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is proposed, involving not only coarse-grained duration, but also fine-grained distance between students. First, students' location distribution and duration are captured by non-perception WiFi network logs with highly flexibility. Then, the convolutional neural network (CNN) model is utilized to real-time recognize landmarks in PDR positioning trajectory, followed by the particle filter algorithm to fuse both the PDR positioning results and detected landmarks, thereby calibrating PDR cumulative error and calculating the social distance between students. Next, we analyze the contact degree between students by integrating duration and social distance. Finally, in a campus environment with an coverage of about 600m2, we simulate a COVID-19 case study to validate proposed approach, showing that the average positioning error is reduced from 3.23m to 2.77m. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",contact tracing; Covid-19; duration; pedestrian dead reckoning; social distance; WiFi network logs,"Tu P., Li J., Wang H., Wang K., Yuan Y.",Article,epidemic contact trace campus smartphone base pedestrian dead reckoning rapid spreading infectious disease covid-19 numerous campus student increasingly expose dilemma provisioning safe environment vital importance establish approach contact trace epidemic disease spread cover campus student carry capable device i.e. smartphone work epidemic contact trace campus smartphone base pedestrian dead reckoning pdr propose involve coarse grain duration fine grain distance student student location distribution duration capture non perception log highly flexibility convolutional neural cnn model utilize real time recognize landmark pdr position trajectory follow particle filter algorithm fuse pdr positioning result detect landmark calibrate pdr cumulative error calculate social distance student analyze contact degree student integrate duration social distance finally campus environment coverage 600m2 simulate covid-19 case validate propose approach show average positioning error reduce 3.23 m 2.77 m. contact trace covid-19 duration pedestrian dead reckoning social distance log
an efficient clustering with robust outlier mitigation for wi-fi fingerprint based indoor positioning,2021.0,0.0,"Wi-Fi fingerprint systems provide cost-effective and reliable solution for indoor positioning. However, such systems incur high calibration cost in the training phase and high searching overhead in the positioning phase. Moreover, huge storage requirement for the radio map of a large-scale fingerprint system is another major issue. Several solutions based on crowd-sourcing or machine learning technique have been proposed in literature to reduce the calibration overhead. On the other hand, various clustering methods have been proposed over the past decade to reduce the searching overhead. However, none of the existing systems has addressed the issue of high storage requirement for the fingerprint database constructed in the training phase. Moreover, presence of outlier in the received signal strength (RSS) measurements severely impacts the positioning accuracy of such systems. Thus, this paper proposes an efficient clustering strategy for fingerprint based positioning systems to reduce the storage overhead and searching overhead incurred by such systems and also proposes a robust outlier mitigation technique to improve their positioning accuracy. The performances of our proposed positioning system are evaluated and compared with five existing fingerprint techniques in both the simulation test bed as well as real indoor environment via extensive experimentation.

rf-wri: an efficient framework for rf-based device-free air-writing recognition,2021.0,2.0,"Machines are becoming indispensable in our lives and the requirements of the human-machine interactions are increasing. Conventional devices, such as a keyboard or touch screen, may not be preferred in future's entertainment, home, and industrial applications. Device-free (non-contact) solutions will be even more popular. These solutions often use visual and acoustic technologies which have some disadvantages. The use of radio frequency (RF) waves for human-machine interaction such as air-writing (Wri), is a new and challenging problem. We propose a device-free machine learning-based air-writing recognition framework called RF-Wri which can effectively distinguish 26 capital letters. Two-channel low-cost software-defined radios (SDR) and oppositely polarized antennas are used to provide polarization diversity which makes the accuracy of classification superior. Another critical novelty is the usage of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients as new features to represent RF waveform which provides writing speed and user invariant recognition. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) filters and letter segmentation algorithm are used for signal de-noising and separating the air-writing activities, respectively. It is shown that Support Vector Machine (SVM) can successfully classify the measured RF waves of air-written letters. It is verified with various real measurements that the proposed framework, RF-Wri, achieves 95.15% accuracy in the classification of all 26 air-written letters and outperforms the fairly new WiFi-based air-writing recognition approaches. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",Air-writing; air-writing recognition; device-free; letter recognition; radio waves; RF sensing; wireless signals,"Uysal C., Filik T.",Article,rf wri efficient framework rf base device free air writing recognition machine indispensable life requirement human machine interaction increase conventional device keyboard touch screen prefer future entertainment home industrial application device free non contact solution popular solution use visual acoustic technology disadvantage use radio frequency rf wave human machine interaction air writing wri new challenging problem device free machine base air writing recognition framework call rf wri effectively distinguish capital letter channel low cost software define radio sdr oppositely polarize antenna provide polarization diversity make accuracy classification superior critical novelty usage discrete cosine transform dct coefficient new feature represent rf waveform provide write speed user invariant recognition discrete wavelet transform dwt filter letter segmentation algorithm signal de noise separate air writing activity respectively show support vector machine svm successfully classify measure rf wave air write letter verify real measurement propose framework rf wri achieve 95.15 accuracy classification air write letter outperform fairly new base air writing recognition approach air writing air writing recognition device free letter recognition radio wave rf sensing signal

mmtag: a millimeter wave backscatter network,2021.0,0.0,"Recent advances in IoT, machine learning and cloud computing have placed a huge strain on wireless networks. In particular, many emerging applications require streaming rich content (such as videos) in real time, while they are constrained by energy sources. A wireless network which supports high data-rate while consuming low-power would be very attractive for these applications. Unfortunately, existing wireless networks do not satisfy this requirement. For example, WiFi backscatter and Bluetooth networks have very low power consumption, but their data-rate is very limited (less than a Mbps). On the other hand, modern WiFi and mmWave networks support high throughput, but have a high power consumption (more than a watt). To address this problem, we present mmTag, a novel mmWave backscatter network which enables low-power high-throughput wireless links for emerging applications. mmTag is a backscatter system which operates in the mmWave frequency bands. mmTag addresses the key challenges that prevent existing backscatter networks from operating at mmWave bands.

data acquisition system for preventive maintenance of equipment in the urban tunnels,2021.0,0.0,"Urban Tunnel construction for supporting the Under-ground Transit Solutions (UTS) namely Metros and Subways in highly densely populated locations involves huge power requirements. This power requirement is normally met by the power supplied by the power agencies for the over the ground requirements. However, in the cases of underground work at the drilling site or de-watering sites we need to use the smaller portable generator sets. These generator sets generate a lot of harmful gases and CO2 and in-cases of over loading lead to short circuits and also fire. In the cases of prolonged tunneling times these generators remain inside the tunnel and are not serviced on time leading to gen-sets often going out of order leading to loss of work and may also cause accidents. Regular maintenance enhances the lifespan of the generators. This paper takes the approach to provide a solution to the preventive generator maintenance problems which would take care of reliability issues. In the proposed design we monitor the vital parameters of the gen-sets like fuel levels, temperatures, loads (current and voltage), running time, last servicing time, average fuel consumption, last serviced dates, battery voltages, Air filter life etc. This information is then collected by an on-board Data Acquisition System (DAS) which is then passed on to Cloud via a Wi-Fi connection. Once this information is made available on the cloud, we can apply the Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the failure rates of the generators and calculate the RUL - Remaining Useful Life. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Fault diagnosis; generator condition monitoring; preventive maintenance; remaining useful life,"Kumari S., Singh Y., Siwach V., Singh Y.",Conference Paper,acquisition preventive maintenance equipment urban tunnel urban tunnel construction support ground transit solution ut metro subway highly densely populate location involve huge power requirement power requirement normally meet power supply power agency ground requirement case underground work drilling site de water site need use small portable generator set generator set generate lot harmful gas co2 case load lead short circuit fire case prolonged tunneling time generator remain inside tunnel service time lead gen set go order lead loss work cause accident regular maintenance enhance lifespan generator take approach provide solution preventive generator maintenance problem care reliability issue propose design monitor vital parameter gen set like fuel level temperature load current voltage run time servicing time average fuel consumption service date battery voltage air filter life etc information collect board acquisition das pass cloud connection information available cloud apply machine algorithm predict failure rate generator calculate rul remain useful life publish licence iop publishing ltd fault diagnosis generator condition monitoring preventive maintenance remain useful life
novel indoor device-free human tracking using learning systems with hidden markov models,2021.0,0.0,"This paper proposes a novel indoor device-free localization and tracking approach using the received signal-strength indicators (RSSIs) of WiFi signals. The RSSI feature-vectors simulated by a channel-propagation emulator software are adopted as the training data for our proposed scheme. Prevalent discriminative machine-learning methods are used to predict the locations of a moving human-object. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are also incorporated with such machine-learning techniques for robust and reliable indoor tracking. In this work, we partition the given indoor geometry into several equi-sized zones and then convert the underlying localization/tracking problem to the classical multi-classification problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the gradient boosting decision-tree (GBDT) classifier in conjunction with the Viterbi algorithm over hidden Markov models leads to the highest localization-accuracies of 83.9% for eight zones and 71.4% for sixteen zones. As a result, our proposed new indoor localization and tracking scheme can be very promising for many indoor device-free surveillance applications in the future. © 2021 IEEE.",hidden Markov models; Indoor dynamic tracking; machine learning; received signal strength indicator (RSSI),"Liu G., Neupane P., Wu H.-C., Xiang W., Ye J., Pu L., Chang S.Y., Wu Y., Yan K.",Conference Paper,novel indoor device free human tracking system hide markov model propose novel indoor device free localization tracking approach receive signal strength indicator rssis signal rssi feature vector simulate channel propagation emulator software adopt training propose scheme prevalent discriminative machine method predict location move human object hide markov model hmms incorporate machine technique robust reliable indoor tracking work partition give indoor geometry equi sized zone convert underlie localization tracking problem classical multi classification problem simulation result demonstrate gradient boost decision tree gbdt classifier conjunction viterbi algorithm hide markov model lead high localization accuracy 83.9 zone 71.4 sixteen zone result propose new indoor localization tracking scheme promising indoor device free surveillance application future hide markov model indoor dynamic tracking machine receive signal strength indicator rssi

design of a novel remote monitoring system for smart greenhouses using the internet of things and deep convolutional neural networks,2021.0,3.0,"To support farmers and improve the quality of crops production, designing of smart greenhouses is becoming indispensable. In this paper, a novel prototype for remote monitoring of a greenhouse is designed. The prototype allows creating an adequate artificial environment inside the greenhouse (e.g., water irrigation, ventilation, light intensity, and CO2 concentration). Thanks to the Internet of things technique, the parameters controlled (air temperature, relative humidity, capacitive soil moisture, light intensity, and CO2 concentration) were measured and uploaded to a designed webpage using appropriate sensors with a low-cost Wi-Fi module (NodeMCU V3). An Android mobile application was also developed using an A6 GSM module for notifying farmers (e.g., sending a warning message in case of any anomaly) regarding the state of the plants. A lowcost camera was used to collect and send images of the plants via the webpage for possible diseases identification and classification. In this context, a deep learning convolutional neural network was developed and implemented into a Raspberry Pi 4. To supply the prototype, a small-scale photovoltaic system was built. The experimental results showed the feasibility and demonstrated the ability of the prototype to monitor and control the greenhouse remotely, as well as to identify the state of the plants.

split computing: dynamic partitioning and reliable communications in iot-edge for 6g vision,2021.0,0.0,"Implementation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in 6G era is expected to get widespread attention in the applications of Internet of Things (IoT). Unfortunately, it is a challenging task to run DNN models in IoT devices due to their limited computation capability. Further, remotely deployed cloud is incompatible to support DNN inferences in IoT platform due to its latency constraints and unreliable connectivity during poor network conditions. To address the problems, we deploy edge devices to the close proximity of IoT devices and introduce the concept of 'Split Computing' to execute the DNN inference task among IoT-edge devices. In the context of split computing, we propose two mechanisms that can reduce both computational and communicational overhead by finding a trade-off between them given as follows: (1) Dynamic Split Computation (DSC) mechanism: Selects an optimal partition of DNN inference between IoT device and edge to reduce computation latency and computational resources. (2) Reliable Communication Network Switching (RCNS) mechanism: During poor network conditions, this mechanism provides suitable network selection to decide whether to choose Cellular (i.e., 4G/SG/6G), Wi-Fi or Bluetooth network, respectively based on the available bandwidth. To illustrate RCNS mechanism, we propose learning based reliable communication network switching (L-RCNS) and rule based reliable communication network switching (R-RCNS) models, respectively to provide reliable connectivity compared to Cellular/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth in poor network conditions. Based on the real data-set for Cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth collected by Samsung Galaxy S20 device and Raspberry Pi, we conduct extensive experiments to compare performance of the mechanisms with respect to the state of art. © 2021 IEEE.",Edge Computing; Internet of Things; Split Computing,"Karjee J., Anand K., Bhargav V.N., Naik P.S., Dabbiru R.B.V., Srinidhi N.",Conference Paper,split computing dynamic partitioning reliable communication iot edge g vision implementation deep neural dnn g era expect widespread attention application internet thing iot unfortunately challenging task run dnn model iot device limited computation capability remotely deploy cloud incompatible support dnn inference iot platform latency constraint unreliable connectivity poor condition address problem deploy edge device close proximity iot device introduce concept split computing execute dnn inference task iot edge device context split computing mechanism reduce computational communicational overhead find trade give follow dynamic split computation dsc mechanism select optimal partition dnn inference iot device edge reduce computation latency computational resource reliable communication switching rcns mechanism poor condition mechanism provide suitable selection decide choose cellular i.e. 4g sg/6 g bluetooth respectively base available bandwidth illustrate rcns mechanism base reliable communication switching l rcns rule base reliable communication switch r rcns model respectively provide reliable connectivity compare cellular bluetooth poor condition base real set cellular bluetooth collect samsung galaxy s20 device raspberry pi conduct extensive experiment compare mechanism respect state art edge computing internet thing split computing
accurate and stable wi-fi based indoor localization and classification using convolutional neural network,2021.0,0.0,"Indoor localization is essential for providing location based services inside homes, malls, and hospitals. Wi-Fi routers are available in almost every building and Wi-Fi chipsets are also available in almost every smartphone. Therefore, fingerprinting of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values coming from Wi-Fi routers is a cheaper option for indoor localization. In conventional Wi-Fi fingerprinting methods, RSSI values are collected at various indoor locations and stored in a database. The device which needs localization, collects new RSSI values from its current unknown location. These values are compared with the database and the best match is returned as the current user location. Due to differences in Wi-Fi chipsets and environmental conditions, RSSI values fluctuate which makes accurate, stable, fast, and precise determination of user location difficult. If the user is inside a large multi-floor building, dataset scalability and RSSI fluctuations can make the task even more difficult. User tracking and determination of the direction in which the user is moving also becomes challenging due to hurdles and non-walkable points in the indoor environment. To solve these issues, in this paper we present a Wi-Fi fingerprinting method for large indoor environments that uses 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNN) for floor and region-status (hurdle, walkable point) classification. The procedure consists of collecting RSSI dataset which is then normalized and pre-processed. This step is essential for training the classification and localization model. The trained model can be used in real-time for fast, stable, and accurate classification of floors, region-status and user location coordinates. Based on our experiments inside a two floor university library, the proposed approach can classify the floors and region-status with an accuracy of 70.50% and 81.23% respectively, while the mean localization error is 3.47 m. © 2021 IEEE.",Convolution Neural Network (CNN); Indoor Positioning; Wi-Fi Fingerprinting,"Javed A., Hassan N.U., Yuen C.",Conference Paper,accurate stable base indoor localization classification convolutional neural indoor localization essential provide location base service inside home mall hospital router available building chipset available smartphone fingerprint receive signal strength indicator rssi value come router cheap option indoor localization conventional fingerprinting method rssi value collect indoor location store database device need localization collect new rssi value current unknown location value compare database good match return current user location difference chipset environmental condition rssi value fluctuate make accurate stable fast precise determination user location difficult user inside large multi floor building dataset scalability rssi fluctuation task difficult user tracking determination direction user move challenge hurdle non walkable point indoor environment solve issue present fingerprinting large indoor environment use d convolutional neural cnn floor region status hurdle walkable point classification procedure consist collect rssi dataset normalize pre process step essential train classification localization model train model real time fast stable accurate classification floor region status user location coordinate base experiment inside floor university library propose approach classify floor region status accuracy 70.50 81.23 respectively mean localization error 3.47 m. convolution neural cnn indoor positioning fingerprinting

drat :a penetration testing framework for drones,2021.0,0.0,"As the usage of drones increases, attack vectors to exploit the vulnerabilities increases as well; particularly in commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi based drones. Hence, drones must be carefully evaluated and selected before deployment in the field. Penetration testing is a way to assess the vulnerabilities of drones, but it may require multiple commands, files or scripts and tools to generate and store the results. Many of these existing techniques and tools are dependent on human control and intervention. In this paper, we propose a Drone Pen-testing tool, which has integrated resources to conduct, organize the penetration tests and store the results. The tool has 3 main operation modes-Admin mode, User Mode and Machine learning mode. In Machine learning mode, the tool passively collects the network traffic from Wi-Fi drone access points for 60 seconds. The collected network traffic (in a pcap file) is used to analyze the IEEE 802.11 b/g/n protocol stack to identify a specific target among the surrounding Wi-Fi drones.

The sensor and gateway nodes are designed using the ESP32 SoC with integrated Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 and Wi-Fi. A development board, the Arducam IoTai ESP32, is used for prototyping, testing, and power measurements. Google’s Firebase is used as the cloud storage site for image data collected by the sensor. The sensor node captures images using the OV2640 2MP camera module and transmits the image data to the gateway via Bluetooth Low Energy. The gateway then uploads the collected images to Firebase via a known nearby Wi-Fi network connection. This image data can then be processed and analyzed by computer vision and machine learning pipelines to assess crop growth or other needs. The sensor node achieves a wireless transmission data throughput of 220kbps while consuming 150mA of current; the sensor sleeps at 162µA.

an energy efficient channel bonding and transmit power control approach for wifi networks,2021.0,0.0,"Future green WiFi networks will require Access Points (APs) to minimize their energy usage and maximize their spectral efficiency; equivalently, APs need to maximize their Energy Efficiency (EE).

deepmux: deep-learning-based channel sounding and resource allocation for ieee 802.11ax,2021.0,0.0,"MU-MIMO and OFDMA are two key techniques in IEEE 802.11ax standard. Although these two techniques have been intensively studied in cellular networks, their joint optimization in Wi-Fi networks has been rarely explored as OFDMA was introduced to Wi-Fi networks for the first time in 802.11ax. The marriage of these two techniques in Wi-Fi networks creates both opportunities and challenges in the practical design of MAC-layer protocols and algorithms to optimize airtime overhead, spectral efficiency, and computational complexity. In this paper, we present DeepMux, a deep-learning-based MU-MIMO-OFDMA transmission scheme for 802.11ax networks. DeepMux mainly comprises two components: deep-learning-based channel sounding (DLCS) and deep-learning-based resource allocation (DLRA), both of which reside in access points (APs) and impose no computational/communication burden on Wi-Fi clients. DLCS reduces the airtime overhead of 802.11 protocols by leveraging the deep neural networks (DNNs). It uses uplink channels to train the DNNs for downlink channels, making the training process easy to implement. DLRA employs a DNN to solve the mixed-integer resource allocation problem, enabling an AP to obtain a near-optimal solution in polynomial time. We have built a wireless testbed to examine the performance of DeepMux in real-world environments.

The OoB estimation is the technique used to find prediction error in IRF as every samples are not used when each tree in IRF is trained. So for all those bags unused samples estimate the prediction error for a particular bag in prediction process. IRF recursively partition the data into categories and the derived RF model and maps the results. The proposed IRF method overcomes the overfitting problem, receives the command and applies action according to it. The IRF method uses only eight devices to control and monitor more than thirty devices and this entire process is represented as IoT based Machine Learning (ML) Automation Algorithm. The experimental results show that the IRF method provides better outcomes in terms of accuracy, precision, F-measure, and recall. The RMSE values obtained for the proposed IRF model shows 0.0386 lesser error values when compared with the existing models that had achieved RMSE as 3.607 for Long Short Term Memory- Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as 1.226 and Fuzzy Gain Scheduling (FGS) of 0.4247. © 2021.

ai-driven autonomous vehicles as covid-19 assessment centers: a novel crowdsensing-enabled strategy,2021.0,0.0,"Internet of Things(IoT) facilitates key technologies that rely on sensing, communication and processing in daily routines. As an IoT-enabled paradigm, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) can offer more possibilities for data collection to support various IoT applications and services. As an extension, MCS can be used for data gathering amid COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Bridging Artificial Intelligence and IoT can achieve not only maintaining low infection rates of COVID-19 but can also facilitate an effective rapid testing strategy to reduce community spread. In this research, an intelligent strategy to deploy autonomous vehicle-based mobile testing facilities is proposed to enable early detection of infected cases based upon MCS data acquired through smart devices via wireless communications such as Wifi, LTE and 5G. To this end, a Self Organizing Feature Map is designed to manage MCS-based data for planning of the autonomous mobile assessment centers. Pre-identified zero-day locations and worst-case scenario are considered to determine the best combination for MCS participation rate and budget limitations. Numerical results demonstrate that once 30% of MCS participants are recruited, it becomes possible to cover the pre-identified zero-day locations and enable detection of infected cases under the worst case scenario to determine the AV routes more efficiently than other options for a certain number of neurons in SOFM. The worst-case scenario demonstrates that 30% participant rate ensures detection of infected cases in 27 days for 81 stops even infected cases are outside of the autonomous vehicle testing coverage. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Autonomous vehicle; COVID-19; Decision making; Machine learning; Mobile assessment center; Mobile crowdsensing; Pandemic; Participatory systems; Route planning; Self organizing feature map,"Simsek M., Boukerche A., Kantarci B., Khan S.",Article,ai drive autonomous vehicle covid-19 assessment center novel crowdsensing enable strategy internet things(iot facilitate key technology rely sensing communication processing daily routine iot enable paradigm mobile crowdsensing mcs offer possibility collection support iot application service extension mcs gathering amid covid-19 pandemic crisis bridge artificial intelligence iot achieve maintain low infection rate covid-19 facilitate effective rapid testing strategy reduce community spread intelligent strategy deploy autonomous vehicle base mobile testing facility propose enable early detection infect case base mcs acquire smart device communication lte g. end self organize feature map design manage mcs base planning autonomous mobile assessment center pre identify zero day location bad case scenario consider determine good combination mcs participation rate budget limitation numerical result demonstrate mcs participant recruit possible cover pre identify zero day location enable detection infected case bad case scenario determine av route efficiently option certain number neuron sofm bad case scenario demonstrate participant rate ensure detection infected case day stop infected case outside autonomous vehicle testing coverage elsevi b.v autonomous vehicle covid-19 decision making machine mobile assessment center mobile crowdsensing pandemic participatory system route planning self organize feature map
a framework to identify key occupancy indicators for optimizing building operation using wifi connection count data,2021.0,4.0,"Adapting building systems' operation to occupancy variations can provide significant energy savings, but this is typically constrained by the unavailability of occupancy information. Although several technologies have been introduced to integrate real-time occupancy information in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems operations (e.g., CO2 monitoring), the logistical and cost issues associated with deploying these technologies remained a key issue. Previous studies proposed using WiFi counts as a proxy for occupancy in building operations and showed a strong correlation between occupancy and WiFi counts in several building types. However, the difficulty of integrating real-time WiFi traffic data in building automation systems hinders wide-scale deployment of this approach. To this end, this study proposes a framework for extracting occupancy indicators from WiFi traffic data. The proposed framework utilizes several machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis methods to predict patterns of building occupancy as well as to identify peak occupancy time and earliest/latest arrival and departure times. To validate the proposed framework, it was implemented in a case-study using data collected from an academic building in Montreal, Canada between January and March 2020. Results revealed that the proposed models could successfully predict weekly building occupancy patterns, with an average accuracy (R2D) of 0.98 for weekdays and 0.81 for weekends. Furthermore, the analysis identified peak occupancy timing, as well as arrival and departure times variations between different zones. These findings provided a proof-of-concept for the proposed framework and demonstrated its potential to provide actionable information to modify the sequences of operation of building systems based on buildings’ unique occupancy patterns. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Arrival and departure time; Building occupancy patterns; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Peak time; Poisson regression; WiFi connection count,"Alishahi N., Nik-Bakht M., Ouf M.M.",Article,framework identify key occupancy indicator optimize building operation connection count adapt building system operation occupancy variation provide significant energy saving typically constrain unavailability occupancy information technology introduce integrate real time occupancy information heating ventilation air conditioning hvac system operation e.g. co2 monitoring logistical cost issue associate deploy technology remain key issue previous study propose count proxy occupancy building operation show strong correlation occupancy count building type difficulty integrate real time traffic build automation system hinder wide scale deployment approach end propose framework extract occupancy indicator traffic propose framework utilize machine algorithm statistical method predict pattern build occupancy identify peak occupancy time early late arrival departure time validate propose framework implement case collect academic building montreal canada january march result reveal propose model successfully predict weekly building occupancy pattern average accuracy r2d 0.98 weekday 0.81 weekend furthermore identify peak occupancy timing arrival departure time variation different zone finding provide proof concept propose framework demonstrate potential provide actionable information modify sequence operation building system base building unique occupancy pattern elsevi ltd arrival departure time build occupancy pattern energy efficiency machine peak time poisson regression connection count

multiview variational deep learning with application to practical indoor localization,2021.0,2.0,"Radio channel state information (CSI) measured with many receivers is a good resource for localizing a transmitter device with machine learning with a discriminative model. However, CSI localization is nontrivial when the radio map is complicated, such as in building corridors. This article introduces a view-selective deep learning (VSDL) system for indoor localization using CSI of WiFi. The multiview training with CSI obtained from multiple groups of access points (APs) generates latent features on a supervised variational deep network. This information is then applied to an additional network for dominant view classification to minimize the regression loss of localization. As noninformative latent features from multiple views are rejected, we can achieve a localization accuracy of 1.28 m, which outperforms by 30% the best known accuracy in practical applications in a complex building environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to apply variational inference and to construct a practical system for radio localization. Furthermore, our work investigates a methodology for supervised learning with multiview data where informative and noninformative views coexist. © 2014 IEEE.",Channel state information (CSI); indoor localization; joint optimization; machine learning; multiview data; practical localization; real building environment; variational inference; view classification,"Kim M., Han D., Rhee J.-K.K.",Article,multiview variational deep application practical indoor localization radio channel state information csi measure receiver good resource localize transmitter device machine discriminative model csi localization nontrivial radio map complicated build corridor article introduce view selective deep vsdl indoor localization csi multiview training csi obtain multiple group access point aps generate latent feature supervised variational deep information apply additional dominant view classification minimize regression loss localization noninformative latent feature multiple view reject achieve localization accuracy 1.28 m outperform well know accuracy practical application complex building environment good knowledge approach apply variational inference construct practical radio localization furthermore work investigate methodology supervised multiview informative noninformative view coexist channel state information csi indoor localization joint optimization machine multiview practical localization real building environment variational inference view classification
effective combining of feature selection techniques for machine learning-enabled iot intrusion detection,2021.0,1.0,"The rapid advancement of technologies has enabled businesses to carryout their activities seamlessly and revolutionised communications across the globe. There is a significant growth in the amount and complexity of Internet of Things devices that are deployed in a wider range of environments. These devices mostly communicate through Wi-Fi networks and particularly in smart environments. Besides the benefits, these devices also introduce security challenges. In this paper, we investigate and leverage effective feature selection techniques to improve intrusion detection using machine learning methods. The proposed approach is based on a centralised intrusion detection system, which uses the deep feature abstraction, feature selection and classification to train the model for detecting the malicious and anomalous actions in the traffic. The deep feature abstraction uses deep learning techniques of artificial neural network in the form of unsupervised autoencoder to construct more features for the traffic. Based on the availability of cumulative features, the system then employs a variety of wrapper-based feature selection techniques ranging from SVM and decision tree to Naive Bayes for selecting high-ranked features, which are then combined and fed into an artificial neural network classifier for distinguishing attack and normal behaviors.

application of solely self-attention mechanism in csi-fingerprinting-based indoor localization,2021.0,1.0,"With the growth of IoT services, there has been an increased demand for indoor localization-based services. Wi-Fi access is omnipresent; its high accuracy and ability to use commodity devices makes it suitable to be widely adopted for localization in indoor environments. Recent sequence transduction models such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) mostly rely on recurrent and convolution. Both LSTM and RNN have achieved tremendous results in the localization tasks, but their sequential character prevents them from effectively performing parallel computing, therefore, limiting their performance in processing extremely long sequences. Lately, there have been different models developed for natural language processing transduction tasks that relied solely on attention mechanism, and they performed remarkably well with less computation. This paper is the first to propose the sole utilization of self-attention mechanism for localization time-series modeling. We introduce a self-attention mechanism fingerprinting-based model (SAMFI) which uses positional encoding and masking mechanism. To capture the temporal ordering information, we used the extended symbolic aggregate approximation strategy. Moreover, the proposed model utilizes calibrated channel state information as location fingerprints. SAMFI's pivotal concept is simple and empirically potent. The obtained results significantly minimized the location error on the collected dataset with an accuracy level score of 86.5% outperforming both RNN and LSTM models which scored 82.6 and 67.5%, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.",Channel state information (CSI); Deep learning; Fingerprinting (FP); Indoor localization; Self-attention mechanism (SAM),"Nkabiti K.P., Chen Y.",Article,application solely self attention mechanism csi fingerprinting base indoor localization growth iot service increase demand indoor localization base service access omnipresent high accuracy ability use commodity device make suitable widely adopt localization indoor environment recent sequence transduction model recurrent neural rnn long short term memory lstm rely recurrent convolution lstm rnn achieve tremendous result localization task sequential character prevent effectively perform parallel computing limit process extremely long sequence lately different model develop natural language processing transduction task rely solely attention mechanism perform remarkably computation sole utilization self attention mechanism localization time series modeling introduce self attention mechanism fingerprinting base model samfi use positional encoding masking mechanism capture temporal ordering information extended symbolic aggregate approximation strategy propose model utilize calibrate channel state information location fingerprint samfi pivotal concept simple empirically potent obtain result significantly minimize location error collected dataset accuracy level score 86.5 outperform rnn lstm model score 82.6 67.5 respectively author(s exclusive licence springer verlag london ltd springer nature channel state information csi deep fingerprint fp indoor localization self attention mechanism sam
applications of intelligent radio technologies in unlicensed cellular networks - a survey,2021.0,0.0,"Demands for high-speed wireless data services grow rapidly. It is a big challenge to increasing the network capacity operating on licensed spectrum resources. Unlicensed spectrum cellular networks have been proposed as a solution in response to severe spectrum shortage.

These types of wheelchairs are gradually replacing the traditional wheelchairs; however, their expensive costs are preventing a large size of disabled people from having one. According to the organization of World Health (WHO), only 5 to 15% out of 70 million disabled people have access to wheelchairs. Therefore, we need to offer a cost-effective Smart that not only minimized the cost but also provides plenty of features that use the latest components and technologies.

wiwave: wifi-based human activity recognition using the wavelet integrated cnn,2021.0,0.0,"Nowadays, WiFi-based human activity recognition (HAR), as a key enabler of building smart home, has gained tremendous attention because of its superior properties such as privacy protection and low-cost deployment. Since each human motion within the signal coverage would cause different wireless channel disturbances, it is possible to identify and interpret these activity-induced signal changes for human behavior recognition. Although many approaches attempt to extract distinct patterns from WiFi measurements corresponding to user activities, the signals can be easily attenuated due to environmental variations in the real settings, so that their recognition accuracy may be severely deteriorated. In order to extract the key features in a more distinguished way, in this paper, we propose WiWave, a WiFi-based device-free HAR system leveraging wavelet integrated convolutional neural network (CNN). Instead of utilizing pooling operations, our proposed network has introduced discrete wavelet transform (DWT) into the convolutional architectures, which can combine the good time-frequency local characteristics of the wavelet transform with the self-learning ability of the neural network. Consequently, not only high-level features from low-frequency components can be obtained automatically, but also the the size of feature map can be reduced.

wi-fi csi based human sign language recognition using lstm network,2021.0,0.0,"Human sign language gesture recognition is an emerging application in the domain of Wi-Fi-based recognition. The recognition application utilizes the Channel State Information (CSI) of the Wi-Fi signal and captures the human gestures as signal amplitude and phase values. Most existing gesture recognition studies utilize only the amplitude values ignoring the phase information. Few works use both amplitude and phase information for recognition application. Besides, the existing studies adopt deep learning networks, especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to improve recognition performance better. This motivates the present work to study the influence of using (i) amplitude values and (ii) amplitude and phase values together, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, as an alternate for CNN. Moreover, the proposed LSTM framework is fed with the CSI values without much pre-processing applied on it, except standardizing the data to make it more suitable for classification. This paper applies the proposed LSTM framework on a public sign language gesture dataset, SignFi with Adam and SGDM optimizer and analyses the performance with increasing hidden units.

multiauth: enable multi-user authentication with single commodity wifi device,2021.0,0.0,"With the increasing integration of humans and the cyber world, user authentication becomes critical to support various emerging application scenarios requiring security guarantees. Existing works utilize Channel State Information (CSI) of WiFi signals to capture single human activities for non-intrusive and device-free user authentication, but multi-user authentication remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a multi-user authentication system, MultiAuth, which can authenticate multiple users with a single commodity WiFi device. The key idea is to profile multipath components of WiFi signals induced by multiple users, and construct individual CSI from the multipath components to solely characterize each user for user authentication. Specifically, we propose a MUltipath Time-of-Arrival measurement algorithm (MUTA) to profile multipath components of WiFi signals in high resolution. Then, after aggregating and separating the multipath components related to users, MultiAuth constructs individual CSI based on the multipath components to solely characterize each user. To identify users, MultiAuth further extracts user behavior profiles based on the individual CSI of each user through time-frequency analysis, and leverages a dual-task neural network for robust user authentication.

wifi-based indoor localization using clustering and fusion fingerprint,2021.0,0.0,"Due to the free deployment of the additional network infrastructure, WiFi-based indoor localization has drawn researchers' attention in recent years. However, the accuracy and robustness of WiFi-based indoor localization systems are severely undermined by the fluctuation of received signal strength (RSS). To mitigate the problem, in this paper, we propose a WiFi localization framework via fingerprint clustering and adaptive k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) based on fusion fingerprint. First, in the offline phase, we cluster the offline fingerprints via Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to divide the localization area into several subareas. Then a random forest-based subarea classifier is trained by the offline data and corresponding subarea labels. In the online phase, the subarea of the query fingerprint is firstly predicted by the trained RF-based classifier. Finally, a fusion fingerprint-based adaptive KNN algorithm is utilized to estimate the location in the predicted subarea. In the experiment conducted, the localization performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with other representative methods.

wi-fi based student attendance recording system using logistic regression classification algorithm,2021.0,0.0,"Monitoring students attendance is a crucial part of higher education. It has been established that students' attendance throughout the semester has positive correlations with their academic performances. The conventional method of recording atten- dance using a pen and paper is both time consuming and prone to cheating.

towards csi-based diversity activity recognition via lstm-cnn encoder-decoder neural network,2021.0,0.0,"Human activity recognition using WiFi signals is widespread for smart-environment sensing domain in recent years. Existing researches use learning-based methods to obtain several features of activity data and then recognize human activities. As we know, propagation characteristics of WiFi signals are different for individuals under different place conditions even in the same environment. In this paper, we focus on how to weaken the accuracy differences among individuals on activity recognition and improve the robustness in one indoor environment. Based on this, we design a novel deep learning model called LCED which consists of one LSTM-based Encoder, features image presentation, and one CNN-based Decoder to weaken the accuracy differences among individuals on activity recognition. We first use a low-pass filter to remove high-frequency noise data in time-sequence signal data and design variance-based window method to determine the start and the end of time-sequence signal data corresponding to an activity. After that, we utilize the proposed LCED model to learn informative features space of activity data and improve the accuracy of sixteen activities.

control of an electric wheelchair using multimodal biosignals and machine learning,2021.0,0.0,"While the current design of electric wheelchairs is very well established, people with hand disability or motor impairment are limited in their independence. The incorporation of multiple bio-signals in commercial electric wheelchair control systems would increase functionality of the assistive devices for people with restricted or erratic hand movement, consequently increasing the quality of life of such users. This study reports on the implementation of a multimodal bio-signal control system for an electric wheelchair. In this design, wheelchair control via the standard joystick was replaced by a wireless EEG headset with four direction modes - forward, turn (left), turn (right), and neutral/no movement. Control of the movement of the chair is obtained through the analysis of EEG signals, EOG signals and some EMG signals, measured simultaneously. Data is gathered from a minimum number of electrodes, six in total, residing on the low cost commercial Emotiv EPOC+ EEG Headset. Bio-signals are sent from the EPOC+ to the USB dongle in a computer, which filters and processes the data using Python scripts. A moving average gradient thresholding Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules paradigm has been implemented to ascertain the intended movement direction of the user. The movement intention class is sent via Wi-Fi to a Raspberry Pi with custom PCB which is wired into the joystick plug. The multi-modal bio-signal system proves highly effective, obtaining a classification accuracy of 97.7% over three different trials, though seven instances of false positives were observed, prompting future optimisation of the classification system. © 2021 IEEE.",,"O'Brien S., Alici G.",Conference Paper,control electric wheelchair multimodal biosignal machine current design electric wheelchair establish people hand disability motor impairment limit independence incorporation multiple bio signal commercial electric wheelchair control system increase functionality assistive device people restricted erratic hand movement consequently increase quality life user report implementation multimodal bio signal control electric wheelchair design wheelchair control standard joystick replace eeg headset direction mode forward turn left turn neutral movement control movement chair obtain eeg signal eog signal emg signal measure simultaneously gather minimum number electrode total reside low cost commercial emotiv epoc+ eeg headset bio signal send epoc+ usb dongle computer filter process python script move average gradient thresholde multiple classification ripple rule paradigm implement ascertain intend movement direction user movement intention class send raspberry pi custom pcb wire joystick plug multi modal bio signal prove highly effective obtain classification accuracy 97.7 different trial seven instance false positive observe prompt future optimisation classification

Recycling contamination also occurs when harmful wastes are mixed together.

seremas: self-resilient mobile autonomous systems through predictive edge computing,2021.0,0.0,"Edge computing enables Mobile Autonomous Systems (MASs) to execute continuous streams of heavy-duty mission-critical processing tasks, such as real-Time obstacle detection and navigation. However, in practical applications, erratic patterns in channel quality, network load, and edge server load can interrupt the task flow's execution, which necessarily leads to severe disruption of the system's key operations. Existing work has mostly tackled the problem with reactive approaches, which cannot guarantee task-level reliability. Conversely, in this paper we focus on learning-based predictive edge computing to achieve self-resilient task offloading. By conducting a preliminary experimental evaluation, we show that there is no dominant feature that can predict the edge-MAS system reliability, which calls for an ensemble and selection of weaker features. To tackle the complexity of the problem, we propose SeReMAS, a data-driven optimization framework. We first mathematically formulate a Redundant Task Offloading Problem (RTOP), where a MAS may connect to multiple edge servers for redundancy, and needs to select which server(s) to transmit its computing tasks in order to maximize the probability of task execution while minimizing channel and edge resource utilization. We then create a predictor based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which produces the optimum task assignment based on application-, network-and telemetry-based features. We prototype SeReMAS on a testbed composed by a Tarot650 quadcopter drone, mounting a PixHawk flight controller, a Jetson Nano board, and three 802.11n WiFi interfaces. We extensively evaluate SeReMAS by considering an application where one drone offloads high-resolution images for real-Time analysis to three edge servers on the ground. Experimental results show that SeReMAS improves the task execution probability by 17% with respect to existing reactive-based approaches.

dimmer: self-adaptive network-wide flooding with reinforcement learning,2021.0,0.0,"The last decade saw an emergence of Synchronous Transmissions (ST) as an effective communication paradigm in low-power wireless networks. Numerous ST protocols provide high reliability and energy efficiency in normal wireless conditions, for a large variety of traffic requirements. Recently, with the EWSN dependability competitions, the community pushed ST to harsher and highly-interfered environments, improving upon classical ST protocols through the use of custom rules, hand-tailored parameters, and additional retransmissions. The results are sophisticated protocols, that require prior expert knowledge and extensive testing, often tuned for a specific deployment and envisioned scenario. In this paper, we explore how ST protocols can benefit from self-adaptivity; a self-adaptive ST protocol selects itself its best parameters to (1) tackle external environment dynamics and (2) adapt to its topology over time. We introduce Dimmer as a self-adaptive ST protocol. Dimmer builds on LWB and uses Reinforcement Learning to tune its parameters and match the current properties of the wireless medium. By learning how to behave from an unlabeled dataset, Dimmer adapts to different interference types and patterns, and is able to tackle previously unseen interference. With Dimmer, we explore how to efficiently design AI-based systems for constrained devices, and outline the benefits and downfalls of AI-based low-power networking. We evaluate our protocol on two deployments of resource-constrained nodes achieving 95.8 % reliability against strong, unknown WiFi interference.

Such an infrastructure-based WLAN, commonly known as Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) network, needs to support voice service since in general it contributes a significant portion of the traffic supporting personal communication. In this context, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) over WiFi or Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) is one amongst the very prominent solutions. To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for VoWiFi calls, it is essential to develop an adequate call admission control (CAC) policy. Such policy requires VoWiFi cell capacity. In this paper, we have derived analytical models to find capacity of the IEEE 802.11ac standard Access Point (AP) providing VoWiFi service. To analyze WLAN AP capacity for VoWiFi service, we have used DCF Inter-frame Spacing (DIFS) for sensing channel status before sending data from one station to another and Short Inter-frame Spacing (SIFS) is used for acknowledgement, Request To Send (RTS) and Clear To Send (CTS) frames.

smart replication for seamless and efficient real time communication in underground railway train,2021.0,0.0,"In this paper, we consider the task of transporting mission-critical traffic, with strict QoS requirements for high availability and low packet loss, in underground trains that are equipped with multiple WiFi backhauls. We observe that the commonly used simple replication approach for mitigating frequent handovers comes at the cost of many duplicate packet transmissions and so wasted network capacity. Instead we take the approach of predicting when a handover is about to occur and only replicating packets shortly before it happens, significantly reducing the amount of redundancy needed and freeing up network resources. We propose a novel neural network predictor, based only on features extracted from the WiFi client log, that predicts when a handover will occur. We train and evaluate our predictor on a large data set collected in a production environment, and show it predicts handover with high accuracy. We use this predictor as a basis for an adaptive replication scheme and compare it against simple replication and no replication. Results show that when application throughput is low compared to link capacity, our scheme achieves 91% of the loss reduction provided by simple replication on average while using only 13% of the redundancy and experiencing 20% less latency.

We first employ an auto-encoder to extract representative latent codes of fingerprints. Such an extraction is proven to be more reliable than simply using a deep neural network to extract representative features since a latent code can be reverted back to its original input.

the effect of real-world interference on cnn feature extraction and machine learning classification of unmanned aerial systems,2021.0,0.0,"Small unmanned aerial systems (UASs) present many potential solutions and enhancements to industry today but equally pose a significant security challenge. We only need to look at the levels of disruption caused by UASs at airports in recent years. The accuracy of UAS detection and classification systems based on radio frequency (RF) signals can be hindered by other interfering signals present in the same frequency band, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of real-world interference from Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals concurrently on convolutional neural network (CNN) feature extraction and machine learning classification of UASs. We assess multiple UASs that operate using different transmission systems: Wi-Fi, Lightbridge 2.0, OcuSync 1.0, OcuSync 2.0 and the recently released OcuSync 3.0. We consider 7 popular UASs, evaluating 2 class UAS detection, 8 class UAS type classification and 21 class UAS flight mode classification.

We also show that UASs that are operating using the same transmission system can be distinguished.

atari: a graph convolutional neural network approach for performance prediction in next-generation wlans,2021.0,1.0,"IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) is one of the technologies that provides high performance with a high density of connected devices to support emerging demanding services, such as virtual and augmented reality. However, in highly dense deployments, Wi-Fi performance is severely affected by interference. This problem is even worse in new standards, such as 802.11n/ac, where new features such as Channel Bonding (CB) are introduced to increase network capacity but at the cost of using wider spectrum channels. Finding the best channel assignment in dense deployments under dynamic environments with CB is challenging, given its combinatorial nature. Therefore, the use of analytical or system models to predict Wi-Fi performance after potential changes (e.g., dynamic channel selection with CB, and the deployment of new devices) are not suitable, due to either low accuracy or high computational cost.

clustering-based noise elimination scheme for data pre-processing for deep learning classifier in fingerprint indoor positioning system,2021.0,1.0,"Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning systems have a simple layout and a low cost, and they have gradually become popular in both academia and industry. However, due to the poor stability of Wi-Fi signals, it is difficult to accurately decide the position based on a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) by using a traditional dataset and a deep learning classifier. To overcome this difficulty, we present a clustering-based noise elimination scheme (CNES) for RSSI-based datasets. The scheme facilitates the region-based clustering of RSSIs through density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise. In this scheme, the RSSI-based dataset is preprocessed and noise samples are removed by CNES. This experiment was carried out in a dynamic environment, and we evaluated the lab simulation results of CNES using deep learning classifiers. The results showed that applying CNES to the test database to eliminate noise will increase the success probability of fingerprint location. The lab simulation results show that after using CNES, the average positioning accuracy of margin-zero (zero-meter error), margin-one (two-meter error), and margin-two (four-meter error) in the database increased by 17.78%, 7.24%, and 4.75%, respectively. We evaluated the simulation results with a real time testing experiment, where the result showed that CNES improved the average positioning accuracy to 22.43%, 9.15%, and 5.21% for margin-zero, margin-one, and margin-two error, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

from point to space: 3d moving human pose estimation using commodity wifi,2021.0,0.0,"In this letter, we present Wi-Mose, the first 3D moving human pose estimation system using commodity WiFi. Previous WiFi-based works have achieved 2D and 3D pose estimation. These solutions either capture poses from one perspective or construct poses of people who are at a fixed point, preventing their wide adoption in daily scenarios. To reconstruct 3D poses of people who move throughout the space, we fuse the amplitude and phase of Channel State Information (CSI) into CSI image which can provide both pose and position information. Besides, we design a neural network to extract features which are only associated with poses from CSI images and then convert the features into key-point coordinates. Experimental results show that Wi-Mose can localize key-point with 29.7 mm and 37.8 mm Procrustes analysis Mean Per Joint Position Error (P-MPJPE) in the Line of Sight (LoS) and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) scenarios, respectively, achieving higher performance than the state-of-the-art method.

multipath tcp meets transfer learning: a novel edge-based learning for industrial iot,2021.0,3.0,"We consider a fifth-generation (5G)-empowered future Industrial IoT (IIoT) networking problem where IIoT machines are capable of communicating and sharing their data networking knowledge gained (and experiences) with other neighboring devices/tools. For such an IIoT setting, deep-learning (DL)-based communication protocols are known to be highly efficient but having a computationally complex training procedure in terms of both time/space and volume of data sets. One solution for such training is to be completed offline for each equipment and machines of IIoT before deployment. A better approach would be to replicate the model from the expert existing machine and implant it into new machines. Such training for the transfer of knowledge can be done by manufacturers using high computational power, even for large-scale DL models. After sufficient training and the desired level of accuracy, the trained machines can be deployed in the smart factory equipment to perform life-long collaborative learning. We design a novel distributed transfer learning (TL) framework to maximize multipath communication networking performance for Industry 4.0 environment. To conduct seamless sharing of knowledge gain by the multipath TCP (MPTCP) agents and tackle retraining issues of DL-based approaches, we investigate TL for MPTCP from the IIoT networking perspective. With relevant insights from transfer and collaborative learning, we develop a distributed TL-MPTCP framework to accelerate the learning efficiency and enhance the performance of newly deployed machines.

smartphone power management based on convlstm model,2021.0,1.0,"The battery capacity of smartphones is limited, and power saving is crucial. In this paper, we propose a power management approach depends on the users’ usage patterns. To save power, we need to know in which time interval the most power is consumed. The convolutional long short-term memory network (ConvLSTM) model provides learning long sequence dependencies based on time series data. The battery usage data is processed with the ConvLSTM model to predict every 30 min of the next 24-h remaining battery capacity of the smartphone. Then, the rate of power consumption is calculated for each hour interval according to predicted values of the remaining battery capacity. Depending upon the rates of power consumption, the value of numeric features (screen brightness, media volume, etc.) is reduced and non-numeric features (GPS, Wi-Fi, etc.) are turned off. Our approach saved much power at some time interval, besides saved up to 21% power saving overall. The performances of CNN, RNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, ConvLSTM, and ARIMA were also evaluated.

deep learning for classification of pediatric otitis media,2021.0,1.0,"Objectives/Hypothesis: To create a new strategy for monitoring pediatric otitis media (OM), we developed a brief, reliable, and objective method for automated classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with images from otoscope. Study Design: Prospective study. Methods: An otoscopic image classifier for pediatric OM was built upon the idea of deep learning and transfer learning using the two most widely used CNN architectures named Xception and MobileNet-V2. Otoscopic images, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and normal ears were obtained from our institution. Among qualified otoendoscopic images, 10,703 images were used for training, and 1,500 images were used for testing. In addition, 102 images captured by smartphone with WI-FI connected otoscope were used as a prospective test set to evaluate the model for home screening and monitoring. Results: For all diagnoses combined in the test set, the Xception model and the MobileNet-V2 model had similar overall accuracies of 97.45% (95% CI 96.81%–97.94%) and 95.72% (95% CI 95.12%–96.16%). The overall accuracies of two models with smartphone images were 90.66% (95% CI 90.21%–90.98%) and 88.56% (95% CI 87.86%–90.05%). The class activation map results showed that the extracted features of smartphone images were the same as those of otoendoscopic images.

device-free orientation detection based on csi and visibility graph,2021.0,1.0,"Nonintrusive orientation detection is an important yet largely unaddressed area. It can be used in many important applications, e.g., interactive games, medical care, and various industrial scenarios. Moreover, our novel techniques can be readily implemented in other critical areas, such as indoor localization, objective tracking, movement detection, etc. Many factors can limit the performance of detection algorithms in real-word applications, an important one of which is the negligence of subcarrier correlations. Therefore, we propose to build our system based on existing WiFi infrastructure and its channel state information (CSI). To explore the correlations of adjacent subcarriers, we apply the visibility graph (VG)-based network analysis method to process the CSI data. Specifically, in this article we make the following contributions: 1) we design a CSI-based orientation detection system; 2) we model the correlations between subcarriers using complex network and propose a VG-based feature extraction technique; and 3) we demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our system with commercial products in real-world deployments.

adversarial attacks on deep learning-based floor classification and indoor localization,2021.0,1.0,"With the great advances in location-based services (LBS), Wi-Fi localization has attracted great interest due to its ubiquitous availability in indoor environments. Deep neural network (DNN) is a powerful method to achieve high localization performance using Wi-Fi signals.

a behavior privacy preserving method towards rf sensing,2021.0,0.0,"Recent years have witnessed the booming development of RF sensing, which supports both identity authentication and behavior recognition by analysing the signal distortion caused by human body. In particular, RF-based identity authentication is more attractive to researchers, because it can capture the unique biological characteristics of users. However, the openness of wireless transmission raises privacy concerns since human behaviors can expose the massive private information of users, which impedes the real-world implementation of RF-based user authentication applications. Unfortunately, it is difficult to filter out the behavior information from the collected RF signals.In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving deep neural network named BPCloak to erase the behavior information in RF signals while retaining the ability of user authentication. We conduct extensive experiments over mainstream RF signals collected from three real wireless systems, including the WiFi, Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), and millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. The experimental results show that BPCloak significantly reduces the behavior recognition accuracy, i.e., 85%+, 75%+, and 65%+ reduction for WiFi, RFID, and mmWave systems respectively, merely with a slight penalty of accuracy decrease when using these three systems for user authentication, i.e., 1%-, 3%-, and 5%-, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Liu J., Xiao C., Cui K., Han J., Xu X., Ren K., Mao X.",Conference Paper,behavior privacy preserve rf sense recent year witness booming development rf sensing support identity authentication behavior recognition analyse signal distortion cause human body particular rf base identity authentication attractive researcher capture unique biological characteristic user openness transmission raise privacy concern human behavior expose massive private information user impede real world implementation rf base user authentication application unfortunately difficult filter behavior information collected rf signals.in privacy preserve deep neural name bpcloak erase behavior information rf signal retain ability user authentication conduct extensive experiment mainstream rf signal collect real system include radio frequency identification rfid millimeter wave mmwave system experimental result bpcloak significantly reduce behavior recognition accuracy i.e. 85%+ 75%+ 65%+ reduction rfid mmwave system respectively merely slight penalty accuracy decrease system user authentication i.e. 1%- 3%- 5%- respectively

location independence in machine learning classification of sitting-down and standing-up actions using wi-fi sensors,2021.0,0.0,"The recognition of human activities in real-time remains an important challenge to enable supportive residential well-being assessments. In this paper, we measure and assess patterns associated with dynamic human activities, such as the actions of sitting-down and standing-up, by analyzing Wi-Fi channel state information. Two Wi-Fi sensors are used to capture information about a person's activities within a limited space. The effect of sensor location and activity location within the space are assessed to study the independence of the proposed solution with respect to these factors. From the acquired data, feature vectors of 168 variables of kurtosis, maximum, maximum peak, mean, minimum, skew, standard deviation, and variance values are calculated. Traditional classifiers are evaluated for the prediction of dynamic sitting and standing activities. Results obtained demonstrate a classification accuracy of 98.5% using a medium Gaussian support vector machine. Deep learning using a bidirectional long short-term memory network is also tested for sequence-to-label and sequence-to-sequence classification from time series of statistical measures. These models achieved accuracies of 90.7% and 85.1%, respectively. The proposed feature extraction and applied classification demonstrate the ability of our solution to not only differentiate between static and motion activities, but also distinguish between the similar motions of standing-up and sitting-down.

gpu-based classification for wireless intrusion detection,2021.0,0.0,"Automated network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) continuously monitor the network traffic to detect attacks or/and anomalies. These systems need to be able to detect attacks and alert network engineers in real-time. Therefore, modern NIDS are built using complex machine learning algorithms that require large training datasets and are time-consuming to train. The proposed work shows that machine learning algorithms from the RAPIDS cuML library on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can speed-up the training process on large scale datasets. This approach is able to reduce the training time while providing high accuracy and performance. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a large subset of data extracted from the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID). Multiple classification experiments were performed on both CPU and GPU.

rf detection and classification of unmanned aerial vehicles in environments with wireless interference,2021.0,0.0,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) detection and classification methods include the use of audio, video, thermal, RADAR and radio frequency (RF) signals. RF signals have the ability to detect UAVs at longer ranges but interference from other signals in the same frequency band such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi at 2.4GHz is a known limitation. The experiments in this paper evaluate the effect of real world Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signal interference on UAV detection and classification, using transfer learning via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extraction and machine learning classifiers Logistic Regression (LR) and k Nearest Neighbour (kNN). 2 class UAV detection, 4 class UAV type and 10 class flight mode classification are evaluated with graphical representation from the time and frequency domain. Flight modes evaluated included mode 1 - switched on and connected to the controller, mode 2 - hovering and mode 3 - flying. Results show that Bluetooth signals are more likely to interfere with detection and classification accuracy than Wi-Fi signals but that accuracy can be maintained at over 96% by using frequency domain features with LR as the classifier. Time domain features were shown to be less robust than frequency domain features when interefence signals were introduced. In the presence of Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signals, 2 class UAV detection produced 100% accuracy, 4 class UAV type classification produced 99.9% (+/- 0.1%) and 10 class UAV flight mode classification produced 96.4% (+/- 0.5%) accuracy.

uav detection and identification based on wifi signal and rf fingerprint,2021.0,2.0,"The security threats caused by the popularity of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have received much attention. In this paper, a UAV detection and identification system based on WiFi signal and radio frequency (RF) fingerprint is proposed. The system firstly conducts UAV detection and after the UAV is detected, fractal dimension (FD), axially integrated bispectra (AIB), and square integrated bispectra (SIB) are extracted as UAV RF fingerprints due to their applicability and reliability. Furthermore, we propose weighted AIB and SIB fingerprints to identify UAVs. Since the high dimensionality of AIB and SIB features, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is applied to reduce the dimensionality of these two features. Then the neighborhood component analysis (NCA) algorithm is utilized to weight the dimensions of the two features, AIB and SIB. The extracted UAV fingerprints are stored as training data and test data, respectively. Finally, machine learning algorithms are utilized to identify UAVs. The identification results are as follows: In the indoor scenario, the average identification accuracy of three features (FD, AIB, SIB) are 100%, 97.23%, and 96.11%, respectively.

accurate guidance method and app development for assigning parking spaces based on indoor wi-fi,2021.0,0.0,"Existing parking guidance systems only provide road guidance outside the parking lot but do not provide accurate guidance to specific parking spaces inside the parking lot.

Therefore, the industry must guarantee these properties throughout the complete supply chain, where environmental factors affecting quality are not usually the recommended ones. Temperature, relative humidity, and several gases (O2, CO2 and C2H4) partial pressures, are the most important factors to preserve quality and safety. Therefore, knowing such information will lead to making decisions to achieve a better quality of the commodities and reduce food losses. This research aims to develop a useful system able to monitor variables and predict the shelf life during the postharvest storage. The innovation system presented consists of a wireless sensor network able to connect the measuring devices to several independent routers using Wi-Fi technology. Since, the measuring devices can send the information to different routers placed in different stages of the supply chains, access to the recorded data are guarantee offering high communication flexibility. The device is designed to avoid the main disadvantages of the different technologies available in the market, as ZigBee and RFID systems which need proprietary receptors to connect to the Internet and send the information recorded. The developed devices can record the information when WIFI signals are not available. They send the information as soon as an access point signal is in range. To solve the availability of WIFI signals in some stages (like transportation), a portable gateway node has been developed.

subject-independent human pose image construction with commodity wi-fi,2021.0,0.0,"Recently, commodity Wi-Fi devices have been shown to be able to construct human pose images, i.e., human skeletons, as fine-grained as cameras. Existing papers achieve good results when constructing the images of subjects who are in the prior training samples. However, the performance drops when it comes to new subjects, i.e., the subjects who are not in the training samples. This paper focuses on solving the subject-generalization problem in human pose image construction. To this end, we define the subject as the domain. Then we design a Domain-Independent Neural Network (DINN) to extract subject-independent features and convert them into fine-grained human pose images. We also propose a novel training method to train the DINN and it has no re-training overhead comparing with the domain-adversarial approach.

distributed convolutional deep reinforcement learning based ofdma mac for 802.11ax,2021.0,0.0,"The IEEE 802.11ax also known as Wi-Fi 6, incorporates multi-user (MU) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) based distributed up-link communication, in which stations obtain packet transmission opportunities in accordance with the OFDMA back-off (OBO) procedure and then randomly select one of the available sub-channel, called Resource Unit (RU). However, this random RU selection lead to a high collision rate, consequently degrading throughput and increasing latency. This paper proposes a distributed RU selection method using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Deep Reinforcement Learning (C-DRL) to improve throughput and latency of a wireless network. Specifically, each station locally trains its CNN in an online manner on the basis of energy detection and acknowledgment packets. To reach a steady-state faster, we propose the Greedy Experience Replay (GER) algorithm, in which stations also learn from the non-selected RUs by hypothetically generating their outcomes in hindsight. Notably, the C-DRL RU selection does not require any centralized training or packet exchanges amongst the stations to ensure fair resource distribution. Further C-DRL stations can coexist with standard 802.11ax stations and still improve overall network performance. Comprehensive simulations were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed C-DRL method.

classifying wi-fi from raw power measurements using a neural network adapted from wavenet,2021.0,0.0,"Research into identifying coexisting wireless devices and technologies has been growing in importance as the number of wireless devices increase every year. While many various methods have been proposed over the years, most of them usually rely on using features from the frequency domain. These can usually be distinguishable among different wireless standards. The feature space in the frequency domain is usually limited but less complex than those in the time domain. However, when trying to identify wireless devices that use different specifications of the same Wi-Fi standard, utilizing the frequency domain feature is difficult as the features are too similar between specifications.In this paper, we investigate utilizing a neural network to identify the Wi-Fi standard using raw power measurements. More specifically, we adapt the WaveNet model to take advantage of its capability to handle time series data with thousands of timesteps, an advantage that both recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks do not share. Wi-Fi signals are collected across versions 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax both individually and with multiple standards coexisting across a range of different throughputs. The data is then pre-processed and used to train a neural network adapted from the WaveNet model.

towards more reliable deep learning-based link adaptation for wifi 6,2021.0,1.0,"The problem of selecting the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) that maximizes the system throughput, known as link adaptation, has been investigated extensively, especially for IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) standards. Recently, deep learning has widely been adopted as an efficient solution to this problem. However, in failure cases, predicting a higher-rate MCS can result in a failed transmission. In this case, a retransmission is required, which largely degrades the system throughput. To address this issue, we model the adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) problem as a multi-label multi-class classification problem. The proposed modeling allows more control over what the model predicts in failure cases. We also design a simple, yet powerful, loss function to reduce the number of retransmissions due to higher-rate MCS classification errors. Since wireless channels change significantly due to the surrounding environment, a huge dataset has been generated to cover all possible propagation conditions. However, to reduce training complexity, we train the CNN model using part of the dataset. The effect of different subdataset selection criteria on the classification accuracy is studied. The proposed model adapts the IEEE 802.11ax communications standard in outdoor scenarios. The simulation results show the proposed loss function reduces up to 50% of retransmissions compared to traditional loss functions. © 2021 IEEE.",Deep learning; IEEE 802.11ax; Link adaptation; Machine learning; WiFi 6,"Hussien M., Ahmed M.F.A., Dahman G., Nguyen K.K., Cheriet M., Poitau G.",Conference Paper,reliable deep base link adaptation problem select modulation code scheme mcs maximize throughput know link adaptation investigate extensively especially 802.11 standard recently deep widely adopt efficient solution problem failure case predict high rate mcs result fail transmission case retransmission require largely degrade throughput address issue model adaptive modulation code amc problem multi label multi class classification problem propose modeling allow control model predict failure case design simple powerful loss function reduce number retransmission high rate mcs classification error channel change significantly surround environment huge dataset generate cover possible propagation condition reduce training complexity train cnn model dataset effect different subdataset selection criterion classification accuracy study propose model adapt 802.11ax communication standard outdoor scenario simulation result propose loss function reduce retransmission compare traditional loss function deep 802.11ax link adaptation machine
a deep reinforcement learning based spectrum access scheme in unlicensed bands,2021.0,0.0,"To meet the increasing demand for mobile data traffic, the unlicensed spectrum is used by mobile operators as a complement to the licensed spectrum. Hence, a harmonious and efficient coexistence scheme between LTE and incumbent users such as WiFi in the unlicensed spectrum is urgently needed. At present, advanced artificial intelligence technology is expected to play a key role in future communication systems. Therefore, this paper attempts to introduce the Deep Q-learning framework into the unlicensed spectrum access technology, and further proposes a DRL-based unlicensed spectrum access (DUSA) scheme. In the proposed scheme, based on the proposed access framework, the agent can select the optimal access time and transmission duration by repeatedly interacting with the environment, which can maximize the throughput of the coexistence network while ensuring overall fairness. A large number of simulation results show that the proposed DUSA method can achieve better performance in terms of average rewards, throughput, and fairness than the other baseline methods. © 2021 IEEE.",Deep Reinforcement Learning; Q-learning; Unlicensed spectrum access,"Pei E., Huang Y., Li Y.",Conference Paper,deep reinforcement base spectrum access scheme unlicensed band meet increase demand mobile traffic unlicensed spectrum mobile operator complement licensed spectrum harmonious efficient coexistence scheme lte incumbent user unlicensed spectrum urgently need present advanced artificial intelligence technology expect play key role future communication system attempt introduce deep q framework unlicensed spectrum access technology propose drl base unlicensed spectrum access dusa scheme propose scheme base propose access framework agent select optimal access time transmission duration repeatedly interact environment maximize throughput coexistence ensure overall fairness large number simulation result propose dusa achieve well term average reward throughput fairness baseline method deep reinforcement q unlicensed spectrum access
machine learning-based module for monitoring lte/wifi coexistence networks dynamics,2021.0,0.0,"Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology is expected to shift some of its transmissions into the unlicensed band to overcome the spectrum scarcity problem. Nevertheless, in order to effectively use the unlicensed spectrum, several challenges have to be addressed. The most important of which is how to coexist with the incumbent unlicensed WiFi networks. Incorporating the ""intelligence""component into the network radios is foreseen to resolve the intrinsic network challenges, rather than conventional non-adaptive action plans. Specifically, an intelligent cognitive engine (CE) that continuously monitors the environment, and dynamically decides upon the best mechanisms and their configuration to suit a given scenario, is essential. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based monitoring module that provides real-time situational awareness that is envisaged to provide the necessary adaptivity, intelligence, autonomy, and learning capabilities. The objective of the proposed intelligent monitoring module is to sense, assess and select the most appropriate scheduling and resource allocation (SRA) algorithm at each LTE base station, according to the different coexistence scenarios. We propose a random forest classifier that maximizes the overall LTE throughput without degrading that of the WiFi network. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the monitoring module in achieving robust adaptive results under new unfamiliar network environments.

joint localization and radio map generation using transformer networks with limited rss samples,2021.0,0.0,"Received Signal Strength (RSS) based fingerprinting method is extensively used for localization in the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) environment due to the low cost and ubiquitous nature of Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) signals. However, its wide adoption is limited by the inability of this method to handle temporal RSS variations and mobile device heterogeneity issues. A labor-intensive solution to this problem is collecting large number of RSS fingerprints that capture the variations in the new environment and the new mobile device. In this paper, we propose a RSS fingerprint generation method for the heterogeneous mobile device or new environment by limiting the RSS fingerprint sampling to a few locations. We accomplish this by utilizing a transformer neural network architecture for generating RSS samples. The proposed method with few calibration samples (95 % fewer samples) provides comparable localization performance with the state-of-the-art methods that use the labor-intensive task of RSS sample collection in the dynamic environment for two widely used IoMT testbeds. © 2021 IEEE.",Localization; Mobile heterogeneity; Neural Machine Translation,"Pandey A., Sequeira R., Kumar S.",Conference Paper,joint localization radio map generation transformer limited rss sample receive signal strength rss base fingerprint extensively localization internet mobile thing iomt environment low cost ubiquitous nature fidelity signal wide adoption limit inability handle temporal rss variation mobile device heterogeneity issue labor intensive solution problem collect large number rss fingerprint capture variation new environment new mobile device rss fingerprint generation heterogeneous mobile device new environment limit rss fingerprint sampling location accomplish utilize transformer neural architecture generate rss sample propose calibration sample few sample provide comparable localization state art method use labor intensive task rss sample collection dynamic environment widely iomt testbed localization mobile heterogeneity neural machine translation
convolutional neural network for asynchronous packet parameter identification in dense wi-fi,2021.0,0.0,"Packet collisions due to overlapping Basic Service Set (BSS) interference can result in decreased network efficiency. To overcome this problem, 802.11 stations need to confirm the channel availability through the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) mechanism. Besides energy detection, which has low sensitivity, packet detection in Wi-Fi also utilizes a more sensitive preamble correlation method to check for a valid data symbol within 4μs. Hence, a successful CCA is only possible if the received signal exceeds a certain power level or the contending station could receive the signal preamble. In this paper, we demonstrate how a deep learning-based method like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used to supplement Wi-Fi's CCA capability to increase its sensitivity without requiring the reception of the signal preamble. We also elaborate on the role of filter size and max-pooling in signal processing points of view. Our simulations show that the proposed CNN model can classify different packet formats and their modulation types, even when different symbol timing offsets occur.

robust ml model for human counting using ambient wifi traffic from multiple sources,2021.0,0.0,"Although recent literature has demonstrated the ability to use WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) for sensing physical areas, this method has only been conducted in ideal scenarios. CSI based sensing has yet to been achieved using normal user network traffic, and in the presence of multiple transmitters, and these research gaps currently prevent deployment in the real world. This paper shows that the accuracy of counting human occupancy levels using CSI is dependent on the underlying traffic type, and that there is a degradation in performance when the classifier encounters an unseen traffic type. We experimentally demonstrate that using ambient traffic from end user devices has better accuracy outcomes than leveraging WiFi Access Points (AP). This paper further shows that multiple spatially diverse streams of WiFi CSI can be used for sensing to an accuracy of 99%, and we demonstrate that these multiple streams would reduce the accuracy of CSI sensing systems in literature which are trained for one transmission source. Finally, we show that by training an SVM with diverse traffic types, it can become robust to unseen traffic during the evaluation phase. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Sharma A., Li J., Mishra D., Seneviratne A.",Conference Paper,robust ml model human counting ambient traffic multiple source recent literature demonstrate ability use channel state information csi sense physical area conduct ideal scenario csi base sensing achieve normal user traffic presence multiple transmitter gap currently prevent deployment real world show accuracy count human occupancy level csi dependent underlying traffic type degradation classifier encounter unseen traffic type experimentally demonstrate ambient traffic end user device well accuracy outcome leverage access point ap show multiple spatially diverse stream csi sense accuracy demonstrate multiple stream reduce accuracy csi sensing system literature train transmission source finally train svm diverse traffic type robust unseen traffic evaluation phase

We exploit a multi-step deep feature based image retrieval using the generated hybrid landmark map which represents both trajectory as well as scene features.

This work explores scene recognition problem using state of the art deep learning models with an integrated set based classifier. We utilize compressed networks which can generate acceptable results in minimal inference time. We then trained capsule network for landmark classification, post landmark detection using the compressed network. Further to increase the reliability of the system we utilized GAN based learning for generating dustbin classes such that outlier classes can easily be detected. Experimental results demonstrate that the network confidence about a dustbin class can be considerably lowered, when trained with known class as well as dustbin classes rather than when trained with known classes only.

reinforcement-learning-enabled massive internet of things for 6g wireless communications,2021.0,1.0,"Recently, extensive research efforts have been devoted to developing beyond fifth generation (B5G), also referred to as sixth generation (6G) wireless networks aimed at bringing ultra-reli-able low-latency communication services. 6G is expected to extend 5G capabilities to higher communication levels where numerous connected devices and sensors can operate seamlessly. One of the major research focuses of 6G is to enable massive Internet of Things (mIoT) applications. Like Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), forthcoming wireless communication networks are likely to meet massively deployed devices and extremely new smart applications such as smart cities for mIoT. However, channel scarcity is still present due to a massive number of connected devices accessing the common spectrum resources. With this expectation, next-generation Wi-Fi 6 and beyond for mIoT are anticipated to have inherent machine intelligence capabilities to access the optimum channel resources for their performance optimization. Unfortunately, current wireless communication network standards do not support the ensuing needs of machine learning (ML)-aware frameworks in terms of resource allocation optimization. Keeping such an issue in mind, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based, one of the ML techniques, a framework for a wireless channel access mechanism for IEEE 802.11 standards (i.e., Wi-Fi) in mIoT.

Monitoring social distancing is difficult and expensive, especially in ""travel corridors""such as elevators and commercial spaces. This paper describes a low-cost and non-intrusive method to monitor social distancing within a given space, using Channel State Information (CSI) from passive WiFi sensing. By exploiting the frequency selective behaviour of CSI with a cubic SVM classifier, we count the number of people in an elevator with an accuracy of 92%, and count the occupancy of an office to 97%. As opposed to using a multi-class counting approach, this paper aggregates CSI for the occupancies below and above a COVID-Safe limit. We show that this binary classification approach to the COVID safe decision problem has similar or better accuracy outcomes with much lower computational complexity, allowing for real-world implementation on IoT embedded devices.

gan based noise generation to aid activity recognition when augmenting measured wifi radar data with simulations,2021.0,0.0,"This work considers the use of a passive WiFi radar (PWR) to monitor human activities.

Large training datasets could drive forward machine-learning-focused research in the above applications. However, generating and labeling large volumes of high-quality, diverse radar datasets is an onerous task. Therefore, we present an open-source motion capture data-driven simulation tool, SimHumalator, that can generate large volumes of human micro-Doppler radar data at multiple IEEE WiFi standards(IEEE 802.11g, n, and ad). We qualitatively compare the micro-Doppler signatures generated through SimHumalator with the measured signatures. To create a more realistic training dataset, we artificially add noise to our clean simulated spectrograms.

high-precision rtt-based indoor positioning system using rcdn and rpn,2021.0,0.0,"Wi-Fi round-trip timing (RTT) was applied to indoor positioning systems based on distance estimation. RTT has a higher reception instability than the received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based fingerprint in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments with many obstacles, resulting in large positioning errors due to multipath fading. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose high-precision RTT-based indoor positioning system using an RTT compensation distance network (RCDN) and a region proposal network (RPN). The proposed method consists of a CNN-based RCDN for improving the prediction accuracy and learning rate of the received distances and a recurrent neural network-based RPN for real-time positioning, implemented in an end-to-end manner. The proposed RCDN collects and corrects a stable and reliable distance prediction value from each RTT transmitter by applying a scanning step to increase the reception rate of the TOF-based RTT with unstable reception. In addition, the user location is derived using the fingerprint-based location determination method through the RPN in which division processing is applied to the distances of the RTT corrected in the RCDN using the characteristics of the fast-sampling period. © 2021 by the authors.

wipass: 1d-cnn-based smartphone keystroke recognition using wifi signals,2021.0,2.0,"Keystroke privacy is crucial for smartphone system security and user privacy. User's private information may be leaked if the sequences of keystrokes on the numeric soft keyboard are obtained by an adversary in a certain way. Different keystrokes may lead to different finger movements, causing diverse interference to WiFi signals, which can be indicated by the fluctuation of Channel State Information (CSI) waveforms. In this paper, we propose WiPass, a keystroke recognition system for classifying numeric keyboard inputs on smartphones, which consists of a transmitter (e.g. a WiFi router) and a receiver (e.g. a desktop computer with a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) WiFi NIC). The key inspiration comes from the fact that while performing a certain keystroke near a receiver, the CSI values received by the receiver vary in a unique pattern. WiPass can extract and analyze the CSI Data generated by user's keystroke operations on the smartphone, thus inferring the users’ numeric keystrokes by comparing and classifying the CSI waveforms of the different keystrokes.

wione: one-shot learning for environment-robust device-free user authentication via commodity wi-fi in man-machine system,2021.0,1.0,"User authentication is the first and most critical step in protecting a man-machine system from a malicious spoofer. However, security and privacy are just like the two sides of one coin, hard to see both at the same time, especially by the current mainstream credential- and biometric-based approaches. To this end, we propose WiONE, a safe and privacy-preserving user authentication system leveraging the ubiquitous Wi-Fi infrastructure by exploring 'how you behave' rather than 'who you are'. The key idea is to apply deep learning to user physical behavior captured by Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) to identify legitimate users while rejecting spoofers. The design of WiONE faces two challenges, namely, how to capture the subtle behavior, such as a keystroke on CSI, and how to mitigate the heavy environment-specific training required by deep learning. For the former, we design a behavior enhancement model based on the Rician fading to highlight the behavior-induced information by suppressing the behavior-unrelated information on channel response. For the latter, we develop a behavior characterization method tailored for the prototypical networks to facilitate the extraction of the domain-independent behavioral features and enable one-shot recognition of a new user in a new environment. Numerous experiments are conducted in several real-world environments, and the results show that WiONE outperforms its state-of-the-art rivals in authentication performance with much less training effort. © 2014 IEEE.",Channel state information (CSI); cross-domain learning; deep learning; one-shot learning; Rician fading; user authentication; Wi-Fi,"Gu Y., Yan H., Dong M., Wang M., Zhang X., Liu Z., Ren F.",Article,wione shot environment robust device free user authentication commodity man machine user authentication critical step protect man machine malicious spoofer security privacy like side coin hard time especially current mainstream credential- biometric base approach end wione safe privacy preserve user authentication leverage ubiquitous infrastructure explore behave key idea apply deep user physical behavior capture channel state information csi identify legitimate user reject spoofer design wione face challenge capture subtle behavior keystroke csi mitigate heavy environment specific training require deep design behavior enhancement model base rician fade highlight behavior induce information suppress behavior unrelated information channel response develop behavior characterization tailor prototypical facilitate extraction domain independent behavioral feature enable shot recognition new user new environment numerous experiment conduct real world environment result wione outperform state art rival authentication training effort channel state information csi cross domain deep shot rician fading user authentication
intelligent hybrid automatic repeat request retransmission for multi-band wi-fi networks,2021.0,0.0,"With the increase of Wi-Fi connections and throughput, the problems posed by unreliable connection and unstable delay need to be urgently solved through advanced methods. The IEEE 802.11ax standard was designed to improve the reliability of connection and increase the throughput in dense Wi-Fi scenario where the inter-site interference becomes more serious and the spectral resources are more insufficient. Furthermore, in the next generation of Wi-Fi standard IEEE 802.11be, the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) and multi-band technologies will be introduced to solve the problems of unstable delay, serious interference and insufficient spectrum resources. In this paper, retransmission schemes combined multi-band and hybrid automatic repeat request are deeply studied to improve the retransmission efficiency. Combining hybrid automatic repeat request with multi-band, this paper proposes three kinds of retransmission mode: insisting on the current frequency band (ICFB) retransmission, switching to the backup frequency band (SBFB) retransmission and concurrent retransmitting on dual-band (CRDB). Then, an intelligent selection algorithm of retransmission mode based on machine learning is designed to determine the optimal mode. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method can greatly improve the retransmission efficiency and thereby reduce the transmission latency and increase the throughput for multi-band Wi-Fi networks. © 2021 The Authors.

comparison of random forest and extreme gradient boosting fingerprints to enhance an indoor wifi localization system,2021.0,0.0,"Machine Learning framework adds a new dimension to the localization estimation problem. It tries to find the most likely position using processed features in a radio map. This paper compares the performance of two machine learning tools, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), in exploiting the multipath information for Indoor localization problem. The investigation was carried out in a noisy indoor scenario, where Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) between target and sensors may affect the location of Wi-Fi Access point strongly. It is possible to improve the position system performance by using fingerprints techniques that employ multipath information in a Machine Learning framework, which operates a dataset generated by real time. Usually, real measurements produce the fingerprints localization features, and there is mismatching with the simulated data. Another drawback of NLOS features extraction is the noise level that occurs in position processing. Random Forest algorithm uses fully grown decision trees to classify possible emitter position, trying to achieve error mitigation by reducing variance. On the other hand, XGBoost approach uses weak learners, defined by high bias and low variance. The results of the simulation show that XGBoost reaches a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 1.77m while RF has 1.83m, as shown in Fig. (4). In real time analysis, 40 points were used for testing. RF has an MSE 1.85m and XGBoost has 1.82m.

passive side-channel interference estimation for wifi networks,2021.0,0.0,"WiFi devices operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band significantly suffer from the interference caused by overlapping side-channels. This paper proposes a metric to quantify the Quality of Experience (QoE) impact of side-channel interference based on passive, granular wireless driver parameter samples from consumer grade WiFi Access Points (APs). The variables of the metric are BadPLCP, NoPkt, and Glitch which are driver parameters determined in home environment experiments to be highly correlated to interference. Filed analysis of the proposed metric in 802.11ax and 802.11n deployments indicates that side-channel interference prevents medium access and causes frame losses, which are the main drivers of lowered QoE. Further, this paper proposes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based algorithm to detect the interfering side-channel neighbour, where the wireless driver parameters are the input features. For 6 classes representing interference from different side-channels, we achieve 78% accuracy, 83% precision, 78% recall, and 79% f1-score. © 2021 IEEE.",interference; WiFi; WLAN,"Onalan A.G., Kurtoglu M.H., Soyak E.",Conference Paper,passive channel interference estimation device operate 2.4 ghz ism band significantly suffer interference cause overlap channel propose metric quantify quality experience qoe impact channel interference base passive granular driver parameter sample consumer grade access point aps variable metric badplcp nopkt glitch driver parameter determine home environment experiment highly correlated interference file propose metric 802.11ax 802.11n deployment indicate channel interference prevent medium access cause frame loss main driver lower qoe propose deep neural dnn base algorithm detect interfere channel neighbour driver parameter input feature class represent interference different channel achieve accuracy precision recall f1 score interference wlan
a wi-fi-based approach for recognizing human-human interactions,2021.0,0.0,"This paper presents a new approach for recognizing human activities that involve two humans, referred to as human-human interactions, using Wi-Fi signals. The proposed approach utilizes the Channel State Information (CSI) metric of the Wi-Fi signals to characterize the performed interactions in indoor environment. Specifically, the proposed approach analyzes the CSI data and extracts a set of time-domain and frequency-domain features that comprise salient information to distinguish between the performed interactions. The extracted features are used to construct a multi-class support vector machine classifier that can recognize the classes of the interactions comprised within the CSI data. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated using our publicly available human-human interaction CSI dataset that contains the CSI data recorded for 40 pairs of participants while performing 13 interactions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed approach achieved an average recognition accuracy of 69.78% computed overall the 13 interactions.

task offloading in edge computing for machine learning-based smart healthcare,2021.0,6.0,"Recent advances in networking and mobile technologies such as 5G, long-term evolution (LTE), LiFi, wireless broadband (WiBro), WiFi-Direct, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) have paved the way for intelligent and smart services. With an average of more than 6.5 devices per person, a plethora of applications are being developed especially related to healthcare. Although, current edge devices such as smartphone and smartwatch are becoming increasingly more powerful and more affordable, there are certain tasks such as those involving machine learning that require higher computational resources, thereby resulting in higher energy consumption in the case of edge devices. Offloading tasks to co-located edge nodes such as fog (a cloud-like localized, smaller resource pool), or a femto-cloud (integration of multiple edge nodes) is one viable solution to address the issues such as performing compute-intensive tasks, and managing energy consumption. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and becoming a pandemic has also made a case for edge computing (involving smartphone, wearables, health sensors) for the detection of symptoms to quarantine potential carriers of the virus. We focus on how various forms of smart and opportunistic healthcare (oHealth) can be provided by leveraging edge computing that makes use of a machine learning-based approach.

ieee 802.11 csi randomization to preserve location privacy: an empirical evaluation in different scenarios,2021.0,2.0,"Passive, device-free localization of a person exploiting the Channel State Information (CSI) from Wi-Fi signals is quickly becoming a reality. While this capability would enable new applications and services, it also raises concerns about citizens’ privacy. In this work, we propose a carefully-crafted obfuscating technique against one of such CSI-based localization methods. In particular, we modify the transmitted I/Q samples by leveraging an irreversible randomized sequence. I/Q symbol manipulation at the transmitter distorts the location-specific information in the CSI while preserving communication, so that an attacker can no longer derive information on user's location. We test this technique against a Neural Network (NN)-based localization system and show that the randomization of the CSI makes undesired localization practically unfeasible. Both the localization system and the CSI randomization are implemented on real devices. The experimental results obtained in our laboratories show that the considered localization method works smoothly regardless of the environment, and that adding random information to the CSI prevents the localization, thus providing the community with a system that preserve location privacy and communication performance at the same time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Channel state information; Experiments and measures; Localization; Neural networks; Privacy; Randomization; Wi-Fi,"Cominelli M., Kosterhon F., Gringoli F., Lo Cigno R., Asadi A.",Article,802.11 csi randomization preserve location privacy empirical evaluation different scenario passive device free localization person exploit channel state information csi signal quickly reality capability enable new application service raise concern citizen privacy work carefully craft obfuscate csi base localization method particular modify transmit q sample leverage irreversible randomized sequence q symbol manipulation transmitter distort location specific information csi preserve communication attacker long derive information user location test neural nn)-base localization randomization csi make undesired localization practically unfeasible localization csi randomization implement real device experimental result obtain laboratory consider localization work smoothly regardless environment add random information csi prevent localization provide community preserve location privacy communication time elsevi b.v channel state information experiment measure localization neural privacy randomization

Current researches on emotion recognition usually focus on a single modality (e.g., facial expressions, speech), while human emotional expression is inherently multi-modal. Therefore, emotion recognition based on unimodal alone may not capture an individual's true deep emotion. In this paper, we present a bi-modal emotion recognition system based on two tightly-coupled and emotion-rich modalities, facial expressions and body gestures, for emotion recognition. Different from current mainstream approaches using contact or invasive physiological sensors to capture gestures, which can cause physiological discomfort to users and cannot achieve passive recognition.

dual mode controlled water surface garbage collecting robot by using embedded deep learning,2021.0,0.0,"Plastic waste has become one of the most prevailing environmental concerns in modern society. Without proper environmental control policies and regulations in place, we have witnessed plastic garbage being irresponsibly disposed of into rivers and other water reservoirs, causing blockage of water passage as well as toxic contamination. Since plastic materials are unable to degrade in nature so quickly as biomaterials, human workers are typically required to collect plastic garbage, either manually or mechanically assisted. In some conditions, the maneuvers could cause personal injuries and infections. To resolve this issue, this paper proposes the design and development of a prototype water surface garbage collecting robot.

Unsupervised anomaly detection methods, which are based on machine learning for fault detection in the ICT systems, use various kinds of data such as traffic data, memory usage data, CPU usage data, and text log data. The problem of deploying unsupervised anomaly detection methods in real ICT systems is that these data may have missing values. When a record has missing values, existing unsupervised anomaly detection ignores the records or imputes missing values with specific values. However, both operations lead to decreased performance of the anomaly detection methods. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method that can handle records with missing values without imputation by using a neural network that can process variable length inputs. We experimented with 22 benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method for various kinds of data. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method performs better than existing methods in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) on average for two cases in which 1) neither training nor test data include incomplete data, and 2) both training and test data include incomplete data. Moreover, we experimented with data from a Wi-Fi service that have missing values. The results show that the proposed method outperformed existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods. © 2021 IFIP.",anomaly detection; deep learning; missing data,"Tajiri K., Iwata T., Matsuo Y., Watanabe K.",Conference Paper,fault detection ict system deep model miss fault detection important task information communication technology ict system unsupervised anomaly detection method base machine fault detection ict system use kind traffic memory usage cpu usage text log problem deploy unsupervised anomaly detection method real ict system missing value record missing value exist unsupervised anomaly detection ignore record impute miss value specific value operation lead decrease anomaly detection method unsupervised anomaly detection handle record missing value imputation neural process variable length input experiment benchmark dataset evaluate propose kind experimental result reveal propose perform well exist method term area receiver operate characteristic auroc average case training test include incomplete training test include incomplete experiment service missing value result propose outperform exist unsupervised anomaly detection method ifip anomaly detection deep miss
device-free localization using extreme learning machine with dtw based feature extraction,2021.0,0.0,"In recent years, WiFi CSI based device-free localization has attracted widespread attention. Most of the previous work used Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), and the acquisition of Channel State Information (CSI) significantly improved the localization accuracy based on WiFi.

Then, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to extract the differences between the two data segments as fingerprints. Finally, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used for modelling and calculating the location of the target.

indoor localization using bidirectional lstm networks,2021.0,0.0,"Indoor localization witnessed the flourishing development in location based service for indoor environments. Regarding the availability of access points (AP) and its low cost for industry popularization, one of promising tool for localization is based on WiFi fingerprints. However, because of the interference of multi-path effects, the received signal strength data (RSS) are quite possibly to have fluctuated, thus they may result in propagation errors into localization results. In order to tackle this issue, We propose refined fingerprints based bidirectional long-short-term memory (bi-LSTM) neural network to learn the key features from the tested coarse RSS data, obtaining extracted trained weights as refined fingerprints(RFs). The extracted features of refined fingerprints are capable to demonstrate strong robustness with fluctuated signals and represent the environmental properties.

security architecture for uav,2021.0,0.0,"Cyber-physical systems are used in many areas of human life. But people do not pay enough attention to ensuring the security of these systems. As a result of the resulting security gaps, an attacker can launch an attack, not only shutting down the system, but also having some negative impact on the environment. The article examines denial of service attacks in ad-hoc networks, conducts experiments and considers the consequences of their successful execution. As a result of the research, it was determined that an attack can be detected by changes in transmitted traffic and processor load. The cyber-physical system operates on stable algorithms, and even if legal changes occur, they can be easily distinguished from those caused by the attack. The article shows that the use of statistical methods for analyzing traffic and other parameters can be justified for detecting an attack. This study shows that each attack affects traffic in its own way and creates unique patterns of behavior change. The experiments were carried out according to methodology with changings in the intensity of the attacks, with a change in normal behavior.

"train once, locate anytime for anyone: adversarial learning based wireless localization",2021.0,0.0,"Among numerous indoor localization systems, WiFi fingerprint-based localization has been one of the most attractive solutions, which is known to be free of extra infrastructure and specialized hardware. To push forward this approach for wide deployment, three crucial goals on delightful deployment ubiquity, high localization accuracy, and low maintenance cost are desirable. However, due to severe challenges about signal variation, device heterogeneity, and database degradation root in environmental dynamics, pioneer works usually make a trade-off among them. In this paper, we propose iToLoc, a deep learning based localization system that achieves all three goals simultaneously. Once trained, iToLoc will provide accurate localization service for everyone using different devices and under diverse network conditions, and automatically update itself to maintain reliable performance anytime. iToLoc is purely based on WiFi fingerprints without relying on specific infrastructures.

deepsense: fast wideband spectrum sensing through real-time in-the-loop deep learning,2021.0,1.0,"Spectrum sharing will be a key technology to tackle spectrum scarcity in the sub-6 GHz bands. To fairly access the shared bandwidth, wireless users will necessarily need to quickly sense large portions of spectrum and opportunistically access unutilized bands. The key unaddressed challenges of spectrum sensing are that (i) it has to be performed with extremely low latency over large bandwidths to detect tiny spectrum holes and to guarantee strict real-time digital signal processing (DSP) constraints; (ii) its underlying algorithms need to be extremely accurate, and flexible enough to work with different wireless bands and protocols to find application in real-world settings. To the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks spectrum sensing techniques able to accomplish both requirements. In this paper, we propose DeepSense, a software/hardware framework for real-time wideband spectrum sensing that relies on real-time deep learning tightly integrated into the transceiver's baseband processing logic to detect and exploit unutilized spectrum bands. DeepSense uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in the wireless platform's hardware fabric to analyze a small portion of the unprocessed baseband waveform to automatically extract the maximum amount of information with the least amount of I/Q samples. We extensively validate the accuracy, latency and generality performance of DeepSense with (i) a 400 GB dataset containing hundreds of thousands of WiFi transmissions collected ""in the wild""with different Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) conditions and over different days; (ii) a dataset of transmissions collected using our own software-defined radio testbed; and (iii) a synthetic dataset of LTE transmissions under controlled SNR conditions. We also measure the real-time latency of the CNNs trained on the three datasets with an FPGA implementation, and compare our approach with a fixed energy threshold mechanism. Results show that our learning-based approach can deliver a precision and recall of 98% and 97% respectively and a latency as low as 0.61ms.

an experience driven design for ieee 802.11ac rate adaptation based on reinforcement learning,2021.0,0.0,"The IEEE 802.11ac supports gigabit speeds by extending 802.11n air-interface features and increases the number of rate options by more than two times. Enabling so many rate options can be a challenge to rate adaptation (RA) solutions. Particularly, they need to adapt rates to various fast-changing channels; they would suffer without scalability. In this work, we identify three limitations of current 802.11ac RAs on commodity network interface cards (NICs): no joint rate and bandwidth adaptation, lack of scalability, and no online learning capability. To address the limitations, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into designing a scalable, intelligent RA, designated as experience driven rate adaptation (EDRA). DRL enables the online learning capability of EDRA, which not only automatically identifies useful correlations between important factors and performance for the rate search, but also derives low-overhead avenues to approach highest-goodput (HG) rates by learning from experience. It can make EDRA scalable to timely locate HG rates among many rate options over time. We implement and evaluate EDRA using the Intel Wi-Fi driver and Google TensorFlow on Intel 802.11ac NICs.

signal detection and classification in shared spectrum: a deep learning approach,2021.0,1.0,"Accurate identification of the signal type in shared-spectrum networks is critical for efficient resource allocation and fair coexistence. It can be used for scheduling transmission opportunities to avoid collisions and improve system throughput, especially when the environment changes rapidly.

By using segments of the samples of the received signal as input, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are combined and trained using categorical cross-entropy (CE) optimization. Classification results for coexisting Wi-Fi, LTE LAA, and 5G NR-U signals in the 5-6 GHz unlicensed band show high accuracy of the proposed design. We then exploit spectrum analysis of the I/Q sequences to further improve the classification accuracy. By applying Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), additional information in the frequency domain can be presented as a spectrogram. Accordingly, we enlarge the input size of the DNN.

ahnnet: human activity recognition based on hybrid neural network combining attention mechanism [ahnnet: 融合注意力机制的行为识别混合神经网络模型],2021.0,0.0,"Activity wireless sensing is an important technology to implement health monitoring. Although the research on activity perception based on Wi-Fi has made good progress, there are still some problems, such as the difficulty of feature extraction in the traditional machine learning and the single feature extraction method in deep learning, which leads to insufficient feature extraction and low recognition accuracy. Here AHNNet, a hybrid neural network of human activity recognition integrating attention mechanism is proposed. Analyzing the influence factors of channel state information, the amplitude data of channel state information are used as the basic data for activity recognition, and the time sliding window is used to divide the long time human activity sequence into short time series to construct the sample data, which solves the difficulties of non-real-time and non-fixed length global human activity data. AHNNet parallelizes the bidirectional gated recurrent network and the temporal convolutional network to extract the features of the input data, so as to fully reveal the relationship between potential features of data. To further improve the performance of model recognition, AHNNet is combined with attention mechanism to strengthen the main features of data in bidirectional gated recurrent network. Then, the features extracted from the bidirectional gated recurrent network and the temporal convolutional network are fused to increase the diversity of the features, and the fused features are input into the Softmax classifier for classification to obtain the activity corresponding to human activity data. Experimental results demonstrate that AHNNet has stronger classification ability than the other models, and the average accuracy rate achieves 97.15%, and AHNNet has fewer parameters while maintaining high accuracy. The competing model demonstrates that the accuracy rate is 95.7% in the bedroom environment, 1.45% lower than that in the standard data acquisition room.

deep transfer learning for wifi localization,2021.0,1.0,"This paper studies a WiFi indoor localisation technique based on using a deep learning model and its transfer strategies.

An experiment was performed whereby the transmitter and receiver were separated by a fixed distance in a Line-of-Sight (LoS) setting. Five activities were performed in between them, namely, sitting, standing, lying down, standing from the floor and walking.

802.11ac device identification based on mac frame analysis,2021.0,0.0,"In Wi-Fi networks, devices can be identified by physical features or MAC layer features, and the solutions of device identification can be used to enhance device authentication. Since 802.11ac Standard has been widely applied in Wi-Fi devices in recent years, the traditional identification methods designed for 802.11b/g/n devices will be no longer applicable. Therefore, it is necessary to design the corresponding 802.11ac device identification method. Compared with the physical feature-based method, the MAC layer-based method has advantages of low cost and easy deployment, so it has attracted more and more researchers' attention. In this paper, we use the fields from 802.11ac MAC frame as fingerprints. Through the analysis of 802.11ac MAC frame, a preprocessing method of the frame is proposed to mask strong and easy-to-modified identifiers. Then to overcome the difficulties caused by random changes in field values, we propose a device identification method based on the deep learning to select features automatically.

c-cnnloc: constrained cnn for robust indoor localization with building boundary,2021.0,0.0,"To enable accurate and reliable indoor localization in a multi-building environment, a novel constrained convolutional neural network (CNN)-based indoor localization system (C-CNNLoc) is proposed using WiFi fingerprinting approach. The proposed network has a sequential structure that firstly classifies a building, followed by estimating the user's location coordinate within the pre-detected building. Furthermore, the location accuracy is improved by introducing a new loss function that incorporates a penalty term associated with the building boundary. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing solutions on the average distance error. The gain comes from that the approach tailored to a multi-building indoor localization with the sequential structure is prone to successfully correct outliers, that is, predicted location coordinates that lie outside the buildings. © 2021 The Authors.

automated residential energy audits using a smart wifi thermostat-enabled data mining approach,2021.0,1.0,"Smart WiFi thermostats, when they first reached the market, were touted as a means for achieving substantial heating and cooling energy cost savings. These savings did not materialize until additional features, such as geofencing, were added. Today, average savings from these thermostats of 10–12% in heating and 15% in cooling for a single-family residence have been reported. This research aims to demonstrate additional potential benefit of these thermostats, namely as a potential instrument for conducting virtual energy audits on residences. In this study, archived smart WiFi thermostat measured temperature data in the form of a power spectrum, corresponding historical weather and energy consumption data, building geometry characteristics, and occupancy data were integrated in order to train a machine learning model to predict attic and wall R-Values, furnace efficiency, and air conditioning seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER), all of which were known for all residences in this study. The developed model was validated on residences not used for model development. Validation R-squared values of 0.9408, 0.9421, 0.9536, and 0.9053 for predicting attic and wall R-values, furnace efficiency, and AC SEER, respectively, were realized.

machine-learning-based user position prediction and behavior analysis for location services,2021.0,1.0,"Machine learning (ML)-based methods are increasingly used in different fields of business to improve the quality and efficiency of services. The increasing amount of data and the development of artificial intelligence algorithms have improved the services provided to customers in shopping malls. Most new services are based on customers’ precise positioning in shopping malls, especially customer positioning within shops. We propose a novel method to accurately predict the specific shops in which customers are located in shopping malls. We use global positioning system (GPS) information provided by customers’ mobile terminals and WiFi information that completely covers the shopping mall. According to the prediction results, we learn some of the behavior preferences of users. We use these predicted customer locations to provide customers with more accurate services. Our training dataset is built using feature extraction and screening from some real customers’ transaction records in shopping malls. In order to prove the validity of the model, we also cross-check our algorithm with a variety of machine learning algorithms.

integrated statistical test of signal distributions and access point contributions for wi-fi indoor localization,2021.0,46.0,"With the broad deployment of Wi-Fi networks, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi indoor localization has attained much interest of both academia and industry. At present, most of the currently available Wi-Fi indoor localization techniques focus on increasing the localization accuracy. However, few of them take into account the diversity of Wi-Fi signal distributions and the measurement error associated with RSS values owing to the complicated indoor environment, which consequently results in the low robustness of indoor localization systems. Thus, with the motivation to tackle this gripping problem, we design a new hybrid hypothesis test based on the idea of Asymptotic Relative Efficiency (ARE), which exploits signal distributions by considering different Access Point (AP) contributions to the Wi-Fi indoor localization accuracy. In concrete terms, first of all, the Jarque-Bera (JB) test is used to perform the normality test on the Wi-Fi signal distribution at each Reference Point (RP), and then the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) approach is applied to obtain each AP contribution degree. Secondly, based on the evaluation of the JB test on the Wi-Fi signal distribution, the hybrid Mann-Whitney U and T test is applied to find the set of matching RPs corresponding to each newly-collected RSS data. Finally, the target location estimate is acquired by using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), where the contribution degree of each AP is assigned as the weight during the calculation to find matching RPs. From the extensive experimental results, it is evident that the proposed approach can successfully improve the system performance by achieving a higher localization accuracy and enhanced robustness when compared with the state-of-the-art Wi-Fi indoor localization techniques. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",asymptotic relative efficiency; Chi-squared automatic interaction detection; hybrid Mann-Whitney U and T test; Jarque-Bera test; Wi-Fi indoor localization,"Zhou M., Li Y., Tahir M.J., Geng X., Wang Y., He W.",Article,integrated statistical test signal distribution access point contribution indoor localization broad deployment receive signal strength rss base indoor localization attain academia industry present currently available indoor localization technique focus increase localization accuracy account diversity signal distribution measurement error associate rss value owe complicated indoor environment consequently result low robustness indoor localization system motivation tackle gripping problem design new hybrid hypothesis test base idea asymptotic relative efficiency exploit signal distribution consider different access point ap contribution indoor localization accuracy concrete term jarque bera jb test perform normality test signal distribution reference point rp chi square automatic interaction detection chaid approach apply obtain ap contribution degree secondly base evaluation jb test signal distribution hybrid mann whitney u t test apply find set match rps correspond newly collect rss finally target location estimate acquire k near neighbor knn contribution degree ap assign weight calculation find matching rps extensive experimental result evident propose approach successfully improve achieve high localization accuracy enhance robustness compare state art indoor localization technique asymptotic relative efficiency chi square automatic interaction detection hybrid mann whitney u t test jarque bera test indoor localization

gate-id: wifi-based human identification irrespective of walking directions in smart home,2021.0,5.0,"Research has shown the potential of device-free WiFi sensing for human identification. Each and every human has a unique gait and prior works suggest WiFi devices are able to capture the unique signature of a person's gait. In this article, we show for the first time that the monitored gait could be inconsistent and have mirror-like perturbations when individuals walk through WiFi devices in different directions, provided that the WiFi antenna array is horizontal to the walking path. Such inconsistent mirrored patterns are to negatively affect the uniqueness of gait and accuracy of human identification. Therefore, we propose a system called Gate-ID for accurately identifying individuals' identities irrespective of different walking directions. Gate-ID employs theoretical communication model and real measurements to demonstrate that antenna array orientations and walking directions contribute to the mirror-like patterns in WiFi signals. A novel heuristic algorithm is proposed to infer individual's walking directions. A set of methods are employed to extract and augment the representative spatial-temporal features of gait and enable the system performing irrespective of walking directions. We further propose a novel attention-based deep learning model that fuses various weighted features and ignores ineffective noises to uniquely identify individuals. We implement Gate-ID on commercial off-the-shelf devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can uniquely identify people with average accuracy of 90.7%-75.7% from a group of 6-20 people, respectively, and improve the accuracy by 12.5%-43.5% compared with baselines. © 2014 IEEE.",Channel state information (CSI); human identification; neural networks; WiFi,"Zhang J., Wei B., Wu F., Dong L., Hu W., Kanhere S.S., Luo C., Yu S., Cheng J.",Article,gate id base human identification irrespective walking direction smart home show potential device free sense human identification human unique gait prior work suggest device able capture unique signature person gait article time monitor gait inconsistent mirror like perturbation individual walk device different direction provide antenna array horizontal walk path inconsistent mirror pattern negatively affect uniqueness gait accuracy human identification call gate id accurately identify individual identity irrespective different walking direction gate id employ theoretical communication model real measurement demonstrate antenna array orientation walking direction contribute mirror like pattern signal novel heuristic algorithm propose infer individual walking direction set method employ extract augment representative spatial temporal feature gait enable perform irrespective walking direction novel attention base deep model fuse weighted feature ignore ineffective noise uniquely identify individual implement gate id commercial shelf device extensive experiment demonstrate uniquely identify people average accuracy 90.7%-75.7 group people respectively improve accuracy 12.5%-43.5 compare baseline channel state information csi human identification neural
computational intelligence techniques for automatic detection of wi-fi attacks in wireless iot networks,2021.0,0.0,"These days, number of smart products based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) has been increased. These products are unified via various wireless technologies like, Bluetooth, Z-wave, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, etc. While the need on the wireless networks has improved, the assaults against them throughout the time have expanded on top. In order to identify these assaults, an intrusion detection system (IDS) with a prominent precision and low identification time is required. In this work, a machine learning (ML) based wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) for wireless networks to effectively identify assaults against them has been proposed. A ML prototype has been implemented to categorize the wireless network records into ordinary or one of the particular assault categories. The operation of an IDS is extensively enhanced when the attributes are more discriminative and delegate. Different attribute selection methods have been investigated to identify the best set of attributes for the WIDS. The proposed model is evaluated on aegean wireless intrusion dataset using various parameters like attack detection rate, detection time, precision, F-measure, etc. The experimental evaluation is carried out in the tools like, Weka, Rstudio and Anaconda Navigator Python.

a survey of spoofer detection techniques via radio frequency fingerprinting with focus on the gnss pre-correlation sampled data,2021.0,1.0,"Radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) methods are becoming more and more popular in the context of identifying genuine transmitters and distinguishing them from malicious or non-authorized transmitters, such as spoofers and jammers. RFF approaches have been studied to a moderate-to-great extent in the context of non-GNSS transmitters, such as WiFi, IoT, or cellular transmitters, but they have not yet been addressed much in the context of GNSS transmitters. In addition, the few RFF-related works in GNSS context are based on post-correlation or navigation data and no author has yet addressed the RFF problem in GNSS with pre-correlation data. Moreover, RFF methods in any of the three domains (pre-correlation, post-correlation, or navigation) are still hard to be found in the context of GNSS. The goal of this paper was two-fold: first, to provide a comprehensive survey of the RFF methods applicable in the GNSS context; and secondly, to propose a novel RFF methodology for spoofing detection, with a focus on GNSS pre-correlation data, but also applicable in a wider context. In order to support our proposed methodology, we qualitatively investigated the capability of different methods to be used in the context of pre-correlation sampled GNSS data, and we present a simulation-based example, under ideal noise conditions, of how the feature down selection can be done. We are also pointing out which of the transmitter features are likely to play the biggest roles in the RFF in GNSS, and which features are likely to fail in helping RFF-based spoofing detection. © 2021 by the authors.

designing an ensemble of classifiers for smartphone-based indoor localization irrespective of device configuration,2021.0,3.0,"WiFi-based indoor localization is a popular approach as most buildings and campuses are WiFi-enabled and its fingerprints are captured by smartphones carried by every individual. Due to the different WiFi sensitivity of the smartphones, an interesting challenge subject to varying ambient conditions emerges in this domain. Thus, a single supervised classifier may not be able to provide stable localization accuracy when the devices used for training and testing are different. Accordingly, a more generalized Neural Network-based Ensemble Learning for Indoor Localization System (NNELILS) is designed in this paper to address the challenge regarding device heterogeneity. NNELILS has a heterogeneous set of base classifiers and a Neural Network-based meta-classifier that combines the decisions of base classifiers. Accordingly, algorithms are proposed and implemented on real-life datasets. Our proposed system is found to improve the localization accuracy to 94% when the training and testing devices vary.

5g radar and wi-fi based machine learning on drone detection and localization,2021.0,0.0,"Drone usages have been proliferating for various government initiatives, commercial benefits and civilian leisure purposes. Drone mismanagement especially civilian usage drones can easily expose threat and vulnerability of the Government Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) that hold crucial operations, affecting the survival and economic of the country. As such, detection and location identification of these drones are crucial immediately prior to their payload action. Existing drone detection solutions are bulky, expensive and hard to setup in real time.

user mobile app encrypted activity detection,2021.0,0.0,"Mobile users install different types of applications on their mobile devices based on their interests and needs and perform various activities on them (known as in-app activities). In this paper, we demonstrate that a passive eavesdropper can identify fine grained in-app activities by analysing encrypted network traffic information obtained by sniffing a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Even though encryption protocols are used to provide security over Internet communications, side channel data is still leaked from encrypted traffic. We utilise this data (frame length, inter arrival time and direction) to identify the in-app activities. Further as a first study of its kind, we show that it is possible to identify in-app activities accurately by observing a very small subset of traffic, rather than observing the entire transaction of an activity as presented in existing literature.

testbed development for a novel approach towards high accuracy indoor localization with smartphones,2021.0,0.0,"Due to its deep penetration in people's daily life, smartphone has been proposed as a practical platform for indoor localization. Yet one major challenge is how to handle the non-negligible sensor errors that can become problematic when accumulated over time. To this end, a series of approaches such as fingerprint and pedestrian dead reckoning have been proposed, which, however, either need WiFi infrastructure, pre-installed beacons or can only support certain movement patterns or scenarios. In this paper, we take one step further towards tackle this challenge by carefully developing a testbed that can enable deep investigation on the smartphone-based indoor localization problem and the potential for promising practical solution design. In particular, our testbed only accesses the raw inertial measurement unit and orientation data from the smartphone, making it infrastructure-free and require no pre-installation, and providing an in-depth view of sensor errors and their impacts on the localization accuracy. Our testbed also provides built-in functionalities for localization and supports real-time data processing and visualization, which can be extremely valuable for solution development and practical usefulness. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our testbed, and obtained interesting observations that not only validate the effectiveness of our testbed design, but also opens a future direction to develop more advanced mechanisms such as deep learning based approaches to better compensate sensor errors and achieve high accuracy in practice. © 2021 ACM.",Dead-reckoning; Indoor localization; Smartphone; Testbed development,"Wang Y., Easson L., Wang F.",Conference Paper,testbe development novel approach high accuracy indoor localization smartphone deep penetration people daily life smartphone propose practical platform indoor localization major challenge handle non negligible sensor error problematic accumulate time end series approach fingerprint pedestrian dead reckoning propose need infrastructure pre installed beacon support certain movement pattern scenario step tackle challenge carefully develop testbed enable deep investigation smartphone base indoor localization problem potential promise practical solution design particular testbe access raw inertial measurement unit orientation smartphone make infrastructure free require pre installation provide depth view sensor error impact localization accuracy testbed provide build functionality localization support real time processing visualization extremely valuable solution development practical usefulness conduct extensive experiment evaluate testbe obtain interesting observation validate effectiveness testbe design open future direction develop advanced mechanism deep base approach well compensate sensor error achieve high accuracy practice acm dead reckon indoor localization smartphone testbe development
campedge: distributed computation offloading strategy under large-scale ap-based edge computing system for iot applications,2021.0,3.0,"With the development of multiaccess edge computing (MEC) technology at the network edge, efficient resources allocation and offloading between the resource-constrained edge clouds to maintain load balancing become a looming problem recently. However, most existing researches aimed at optimizing the allocation of computing resources are based on simulation and apply only for some typical Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications on mobile devices (i.e., they all lack of practicality and generality). In this article, we present a novel edge computing platform (CampEdge) with 36 edge nodes based on the wireless access point (AP) for adaptive resources allocation and computation offloading in a complicated dynamic campus environment. We first collected and sufficiently analyzed a large real-world WiFi data set, covering more than 8500 wireless APs and serves 44 000 active end users within an area of 3.1 km2 over three months. A multiclass classification algorithm based on the random forest was then used with this data to accurately predict the state of resources usage at each edge node (i.e., in a busy state or normal state). To reasonably offload and transmit end-users' computational tasks to these edge nodes and optimize the total latency cost among the whole offloading process, we then illustrate a distributed computation offloading optimization strategy to formulate this complicated problem as a multiobjective latency optimization problem based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we briefly discuss the convergence of our system. In experiments, CampEdge was shown to decrease user latency by up to 30%, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

generation of realistic cloud access times for mobile application testing using transfer learning,2021.0,0.0,"The network Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as the access time, the bandwidth, and the packet loss play an important role in determining the Quality of Experience (QoE) of mobile applications. Various factors like the Radio Resource Control (RRC) states, the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) specific retransmission configurations, handovers triggered by the user mobility, the network load, etc. can cause high variability in these QoS metrics on 4G/LTE, and WiFi networks, which can be detrimental to the application QoE. Therefore, exposing the mobile application to realistic network QoS metrics is critical for a tester attempting to predict its QoE. A viable approach is testing using synthetic traces. The main challenge in the generation of realistic synthetic traces is the diversity of environments and the lack of wide scope of real traces to calibrate the generators. In this paper, we describe a measurement-driven methodology based on transfer learning with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural nets to solve this problem. The methodology requires a relatively short sample of the targeted environment to adapt the presented basic model to new environments, thus simplifying synthetic traces generation. We present this feature for realistic WiFi and LTE cloud access time models adapted for diverse target environments with a trace size of just 6000 samples measured over a few tens of minutes. We demonstrate that synthetic traces generated from these models are capable of accurately reproducing application QoE metric distributions including their outlier values. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Access time; Cloud; Long Short Term Memory; Mobile; Network; Neural net; Testing; Transfer learning,"Rege M.R., Handziski V., Wolisz A.",Article,generation realistic cloud access time mobile application testing transfer quality service qos metric access time bandwidth packet loss play important role determine quality experience qoe mobile application factor like radio resource control rrc state mobile operator mno specific retransmission configuration handover trigger user mobility load etc cause high variability qos metric 4g lte detrimental application qoe expose mobile application realistic qos metric critical tester attempt predict qoe viable approach test synthetic trace main challenge generation realistic synthetic trace diversity environment lack wide scope real trace calibrate generator describe measurement drive methodology base transfer long short term memory lstm neural net solve problem methodology require relatively short sample target environment adapt present basic model new environment simplify synthetic trace generation present feature realistic lte cloud access time model adapt diverse target environment trace size sample measure ten minute demonstrate synthetic trace generate model capable accurately reproduce application qoe metric distribution include outlier value elsevi b.v access time cloud long short term memory mobile neural net testing transfer
a bisection reinforcement learning approach to 3-d indoor localization,2021.0,2.0,"The demand for indoor localization services in the Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasing dramatically during the last decade. Many indoor localization systems adopt Wi-Fi fingerprinting with received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) as a source of sensors to localize an object because it is cost effective and can give high accuracy. However, the fluctuation of wireless signals resulting from environmental uncertainties leads to considerable variations in RSSIs, which poses a challenge to accurate localization on a single floor, not to mention multifloor or even 3-D localization. Most existing multifloor methods employ a sequential approach where a different algorithm is tailored for each step in the sequence to determine the floor and then the location of an object. In this article, we formulate the indoor localization problem as a Markov decision process rather than a typical classification or regression problem. A deep reinforcement learning method is used to bisect the search space in a hierarchy from the entire building down to a prespecified distance scale to the object position. This approach significantly reduces the time complexity of the searching from O(N3) to O N), where N indicates the localization resolution. The proposed method tackles environmental dynamics with Wi-Fi fingerprinting for 3-D continuous space. The experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach. © 2014 IEEE.",Deep Q-network (DQN); deep reinforcement learning (DRL); dynamic environment; indoor localization; Internet of Things (IoT); multifloor; received signal strength indicator (RSSI); Wi-Fi fingerprint,"Dou F., Lu J., Xu T., Huang C.-H., Bi J.",Article,bisection reinforcement approach d indoor localization demand indoor localization service internet thing iot increase dramatically decade indoor localization system adopt fingerprint receive signal strength indicator rssis source sensor localize object cost effective high accuracy fluctuation signal result environmental uncertainty lead considerable variation rssis pose challenge accurate localization single floor mention multifloor d localization exist multifloor method employ sequential approach different algorithm tailor step sequence determine floor location object article formulate indoor localization problem markov decision process typical classification regression problem deep reinforcement bisect search space hierarchy entire building prespecified distance scale object position approach significantly reduce time complexity searching o(n3 o n n indicate localization resolution propose tackle environmental dynamic fingerprint d continuous space experimental result demonstrate high accuracy efficiency robustness propose approach deep q dqn deep reinforcement drl dynamic environment indoor localization internet thing iot multifloor receive signal strength indicator rssi fingerprint

dnn based wifi positioning in 3gpp indoor office environment,2021.0,0.0,"As the development of the 4th industry begins, LBS(Location Based Service) technology is drawing attention. AI(Artificial Intelligence), IoT(Internet of Things), and Big Data, which are major technologies of the 4th industry, can be effectively applied to these LBS technologies. In addition, in order to provide LBS technology to users in an indoor environment, the positioning results must be provided in real time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scheme for providing real-Time user positioning results based on AI technology. The proposed scheme is based on Wi-Fi(Wireless Fidelity) communication, and applies DNN(Deep Neural Network), one of the AI technologies, for location positioning in the indoor office environment proposed by 3GPP(The 3rd Generation Partnership Project). In order to perform the user's location positioning, the DNN model learns the RSSI(Received Signal Strength Indicator) value of a specific location collected in the offline step and the corresponding location with one label. After that, in the online step, the location of the actual user is estimated based on the learned model. It can be seen that the proposed scheme achieves higher performance than the existing scheme in terms of processing time for performing positioning through simulation.

deep learning and unsupervised domain adaptation for wifi-based sensing,2021.0,0.0,"With the wide deployment of WiFi infrastructures, wireless signals fill the air in most commercial regions and homes. Human activities usually affect the propagation of WiFi signals, which can be recorded by channel state information (CSI) data. A CSI sample is a 2D matrix that records the temporal and spatial dynamics in the current environment. Recent works exploit how to leverage machine learning and pattern recognition for WiFi-based sensing technology. In this chapter, we introduce how deep learning and unsupervised domain adaptation method further empower WiFi-based sensing. Specifically, convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts discriminative features automatically via supervised learning. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) transfers knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain. For example, we investigate how to leverage CNN and UDA for adaptive WiFi-based gesture recognition. As CSI data is sensitive to temporal and spatial dynamics, the deep model trained in the original environment (source domain) cannot achieve accurate recognition in a new environment (target domain), which is referred to as distribution shift or domain shift. An adversarial domain adaptation approach is introduced to tackle this problem. Apart from classic CNN architecture and adversarial domain adaptation, much recent deep learning progress can be connected with WiFi-based sensing. We introduce these potential directions including transfer learning, few-shot learning, cross-modality supervision, multimodal learning and model compression, which will lead to more robust and comprehensive smart sensing technology. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Channel state information; Deep learning; Domain adaptation; Gesture recognition,"Yang J., Zou H., Xie L., Spanos C.J.",Book Chapter,deep unsupervised domain adaptation base sensing wide deployment infrastructure signal fill air commercial region home human activity usually affect propagation signal record channel state information csi csi sample 2d matrix record temporal spatial dynamic current environment recent work exploit leverage machine pattern recognition base sensing technology chapter introduce deep unsupervised domain adaptation empower base sensing specifically convolutional neural cnn extract discriminative feature automatically supervised unsupervised domain adaptation uda transfer knowledge label rich source domain unlabele target domain example investigate leverage cnn uda adaptive base gesture recognition csi sensitive temporal spatial dynamic deep model train original environment source domain achieve accurate recognition new environment target domain refer distribution shift domain shift adversarial domain adaptation approach introduce tackle problem apart classic cnn architecture adversarial domain adaptation recent deep progress connect base sensing introduce potential direction include transfer shot cross modality supervision multimodal model compression lead robust comprehensive smart sensing technology world scientific publishing company channel state information deep domain adaptation gesture recognition
deep learning for device-free human activity recognition using wifi signals,2021.0,0.0,"WiFi-based device-free human activity recognition applications have been popular for a decade in smart-environment sensing domains. Existing researches extract features of human activity as the input of classic classification methods to train the learning model and then leverage the trained model to recognize activities. The propagation characteristics of WiFi signals are variable for individuals under different place conditions even in the same environment with time. Depending on fixed features, data cannot effectively represent human activity and adapt to a dynamic indoor environment. As deep learning has demonstrated its effectiveness in device-free sensing domains in recent years, deep learning methods have been explored to address difficulties faced by WiFi signals. In this chapter, we focus on how to weaken the accuracy differences among individuals on human activity recognition and improve the robustness in a single indoor environment. Based on this, we design a novel deep learning model called LCED which consists of one LSTM-based Encoder, features image representation and one CNNbased Decoder. LSTM-based Encoder can learn time-sequence representation and encode it to an equal-length vector. Each equal-length vector is represented using features of image representation to compress and keep key details. CNN-based Decoder provides better recognition accuracy by capturing the local effective information of the signal image based on the spatial distribution.

toward intelligence in communication networks: a deep learning identification strategy for radio frequency fingerprints,2021.0,0.0,"In the modern privacy-sensitive environment, identifying a particular radio device among a larger pool of Internet-of-Thing (IoT) facilities has become more difficult than ever. In particular, the identification process is susceptible to security, mobility, and environment changes. Machine learning techniques, on the other hand, offer a unique learning mechanism to reconstruct corrupted signals from noise and interference at wireless transceiver chains, providing a stable and accurate system for applications on wireless communication. In this paper, we exploit a Deep Learning (DL)-based identification strategy for Radio Frequency (RF) Fingerprints. Specifically, we introduce an Echo State Network (ESN), uniquely suited for nonlinear information processing, to discover dissimilar RF Fingerprints directly from raw transmitted signals, allowing the network to discriminate radio devices. Through an over-the-air WiFi transmission dataset, numerical evaluations demonstrate advantages of the ESN over the cutting-edge DL-based identification approaches, yielding an average classification accuracy of 98.11% while significantly reducing the training overhead.

prediction of wi-fi comfort in buildings using support vector machines,2021.0,0.0,"Comfort of occupants in semi-public buildings depends on ambient parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, light intensity, noise, cleanliness, etc. In addition to the above parameters, occupants' indoor comfort is observed to be significantly influenced by the quality of Wi-Fi connection provided for ubiquitous internet access in buildings. Hence, in this work, another important dimension to indoor comfort is introduced-Wi-Fi comfort. A novel comfort management architecture is proposed which employs machine learning to recognize the level of Wi-Fi comfort. The proposed architecture complements the extensive research done in the area of network planning, by providing Quality of Experience (QoE) of Wi-Fi as an effective input to such mechanisms.

wi-fi assisted contextual multi-armed bandit for neighbor discovery and selection in millimeter wave device to device communications,2021.0,0.0,"The unique features of millimeter waves (mmWaves) motivate its leveraging to future, beyond-fifth-generation/sixth-generation (B5G/6G)-based device-to-device (D2D) communications. However, the neighborhood discovery and selection (NDS) problem still needs intelligent solutions due to the trade-off of investigating adjacent devices for the optimum device choice against the crucial beamform training (BT) overhead. In this paper, by making use of multiband (µW/mmWave) standard devices, the mmWave NDS problem is addressed using machine-learning-based contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) algorithms. This is done by leveraging the context information of Wi-Fi signal characteristics, i.e., received signal strength (RSS), mean, and variance, to further improve the NDS method. In this setup, the transmitting device acts as the player, the arms are the candidate mmWave D2D links between that device and its neighbors, while the reward is the average throughput. We examine the NDS’s primary trade-off and the impacts of the contextual information on the total performance. Furthermore, modified energy-aware linear upper confidence bound (EA-LinUCB) and contextual Thomson sampling (EA-CTS) algorithms are proposed to handle the problem through reflecting the nearby devices’ withstanding battery levels, which simulate real scenarios.

To use an RNN model in Wi-Fi-fingerprint based indoor positioning, data set must be sequential.

For this reason, we propose a movement path data generation technique that generates data for an RNN model for sequential positioning from Wi-Fi fingerprint data. Movement path data can be generated by creating an adjacency list for Wi-Fi fingerprint location points. However, creating an adjacency matrix for all location points requires a large amount of computation.

wigr: a practical wi-fi-based gesture recognition system with a lightweight few-shot network,2021.0,1.0,"Wi-Fi sensing technology based on deep learning has contributed many breakthroughs in gesture recognition tasks. However, most methods concentrate on single domain recognition with high computational complexity while rarely investigating cross-domain recognition with lightweight performance, which cannot meet the requirements of high recognition performance and low computational complexity in an actual gesture recognition system. Inspired by the few-shot learning methods, we propose WiGR, a Wi-Fi-based gesture recognition system. The key structure of WiGR is a lightweight few-shot learning network that introduces some lightweight blocks to achieve lower computational complexity. Moreover, the network can learn a transferable similarity evaluation ability from the training set and apply the learned knowledge to the new domain to address domain shift problems. In addition, we made a channel state information (CSI)-Domain Adaptation (CSIDA) data set that includes channel state information (CSI) traces with various domain factors (i.e., envi-ronment, users, and locations) and conducted extensive experiments on two data sets (CSIDA and SignFi). The evaluation results show that WiGR can reach 87.8–94.8% cross-domain accuracy, and the parameters and the calculations are reduced by more than 50%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WiGR can achieve excellent recognition performance using only a few samples and is thus a lightweight and practical gesture recognition system compared with state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 by the authors.

jlgbmloc—a novel high-precision indoor localization method based on lightgbm,2021.0,1.0,"Wi-Fi based localization has become one of the most practical methods for mobile users in location-based services. However, due to the interference of multipath and high-dimensional sparseness of fingerprint data, with the localization system based on received signal strength (RSS), is hard to obtain high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor positioning method, named JLGBMLoc (Joint denoising auto-encoder with LightGBM Localization). Firstly, because the noise and outliers may influence the dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional sparseness fingerprint data, we propose a novel feature extraction algorithm—named joint denoising auto-encoder (JDAE)— which reconstructs the sparseness fingerprint data for a better feature representation and restores the fingerprint data. Then, the LightGBM is introduced to the Wi-Fi localization by scattering the processed fingerprint data to histogram, and dividing the decision tree under leaf-wise algorithm with depth limitation. At last, we evaluated the proposed JLGBMLoc on the UJIIndoorLoc dataset and the Tampere dataset, the experimental results show that the proposed model increases the positioning accuracy dramatically compared with other existing methods. © 2021 by the authors.

wi-fi-based location-independent human activity recognition via meta learning,2021.0,3.0,"Wi-Fi-based device-free human activity recognition has recently become a vital under-pinning for various emerging applications, ranging from the Internet of Things (IoT) to Human– Computer Interaction (HCI). Although this technology has been successfully demonstrated for location-dependent sensing, it relies on sufficient data samples for large-scale sensing, which is enormously labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, in real-world applications, location-independent sensing is crucial and indispensable. Therefore, how to alleviate adverse effects on recognition accuracy caused by location variations with the limited dataset is still an open question. To address this concern, we present a location-independent human activity recognition system based on Wi-Fi named WiLiMetaSensing. Specifically, we first leverage a Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) feature representation method to focus on location-independent characteristics. Then, in order to well transfer the model across different positions with limited data samples, a metric learning-based activity recognition method is proposed. Consequently, not only the generalization ability but also the transferable capability of the model would be significantly promoted. To fully validate the feasibility of the presented approach, extensive experiments have been conducted in an office with 24 testing locations. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method can achieve more than 90% in location-independent human activity recognition accuracy. More importantly, it can adapt well to the data samples with a small number of subcarriers and a low sampling rate. © 2020 by the authors.

wipass: pin-free and device-free user authentication leveraging behavioral features via wifi channel state information,2021.0,0.0,"As an essential way of human-computer interaction, user authentication has attracted widespread attention in recent years. Traditional user authentication methods include Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and biometric technology. However, the PINs are easily leaked to others, and biometric technology requires specialized equipment. Different from traditional user authentication methods, in this paper, we use widely deployed WiFi infrastructure to achieve user authentication, and propose WiPass, which is a PIN-free and device-free user authentication leveraging behavioral features via WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). The key idea is to explore personalized behavioral information captured by WiFi CSI to identify different users. Concretely, we first proposed a data visualization method to visualize CSI data as a set of time-series images to preserve the behavior information of keystrokes. Secondly, all these images jointly input into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature learning, and the obtained 256-dimensional deep behavior features are used to learn a linear support vector machine classifier.

wifi csi-based device-free multi-room presence detection using conditional recurrent network,2021.0,0.0,"Human presence detection via camera-based monitoring systems has been well-adopted in various applications including smart homes, factories, and hospitals. However, its privacy concerns have been raised in many occasions such as daycare centers and homes with elderly living alone. In recent years, literatures adopting wireless signals were proposed to resolve privacy issues for presence detection; nevertheless, existing works can only be applied in a single room scenario. In this paper, we are the first work to propose a device-free multi-room human presence detection system based on efficient star network topology. Our proposed conditional recurrent architecture-based multi-room presence detection (C-MuRP) system extracts both spatial and temporal features from the Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). Associated with a voting scheme, the proposed novel deep-learning architecture classifies the states of multi-room with the condition on current waveform to emphasize present feature states.

improvement of radio frequency fingerprint portability for wi-fi adaptor identification,2021.0,0.0,"As quantum computing technology approaches maturity, the security of wireless communication using data encryption algorithms is facing great challenges. On the other hand, physical layer security technologies using the unique physical characteristic properties of one transmitter like radio frequency/ radiometric fingerprint, localization information, or channel state information are more resistant to attacks using quantum computing technology. Consequently, the research of physical layer security has attracted significant attentions recently. However, the RF fingerprint portability is an inevitable problem in practical applications. In this work, a joint RF feature calibration and weighted feature classification scheme is proposed to overcome the RF fingerprint portability problem caused by channel fading and receiver differentiation.

"rely: machine learning for ultra-reliable, low-latency messaging in industrial robots",2021.0,1.0,"Robotic factory floors are transforming the manufacturing sector by delivering an unprecedented boost to productivity. However, such a paradigm raises questions on safety and coordination, especially when in the presence of unexpected events. Time-critical communication messages for such industrial robots mandate the requirement of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Classical WiFi-connected industrial robots often suffer from the traditional dense network problems prevalent in production WiFi networks, where transmission of an emergency notification packet is 'best effort,' devoid of time guarantees. In this work, we propose a machine-learning-based framework called ReLy that intelligently embeds the time-critical messages in the preamble of outgoing frames at the transmitter. These messages are inferred from the channel state information variations at the receiver. As ReLy is implemented entirely at the physical layer, the transmitter is able to deliver information within 5 ms latency and ultra-high reliability of 99 percent. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of achieving URLLC with moving robots in a busy workshop with a number of other peer robots, equipment, desks, and robotic arms, as expected in a typical factory setting. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,"Sankhe K., Jaisinghani D., Chowdhury K.",Article,rely machine ultra reliable low latency messaging industrial robot robotic factory floor transform manufacturing sector deliver unprecedented boost productivity paradigm raise question safety coordination especially presence unexpected event time critical communication message industrial robot mandate requirement ultra reliable low latency communication urllc classical connect industrial robot suffer traditional dense problem prevalent production transmission emergency notification packet good effort devoid time guarantee work machine base framework call rely intelligently embed time critical message preamble outgoing frame transmitter message infer channel state information variation receiver rely implement entirely physical layer transmitter able deliver information ms latency ultra high reliability percent experimentally demonstrate feasibility achieve urllc move robot busy workshop number peer robot equipment desk robotic arm expect typical factory setting
deep ai enabled ubiquitous wireless sensing,2021.0,2.0,"With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), many kinds of wireless signals (e.g., Wi-Fi, LoRa, RFID) are filling our living and working spaces nowadays. Beyond communication, wireless signals can sense the status of surrounding objects, known as wireless sensing, with their reflection, scattering, and refraction while propagating in space. In the last decade, many sophisticated wireless sensing techniques and systems were widely studied for various applications (e.g., gesture recognition, localization, and object imaging). Recently, deep Artificial Intelligence (AI), also known as Deep Learning (DL), has shown great success in computer vision. And some works have initially proved that deep AI can benefit wireless sensing as well, leading to a brand-new step toward ubiquitous sensing. In this survey, we focus on the evolution of wireless sensing enhanced by deep AI techniques. We first present a general workflow of Wireless Sensing Systems (WSSs) which consists of signal pre-processing, high-level feature, and sensing model formulation. For each module, existing deep AI-based techniques are summarized, further compared with traditional approaches.

predicting student satisfaction of emergency remote learning in higher education during covid-19 using machine learning techniques,2021.0,7.0,"Despite the wide adoption of emergency remote learning (ERL) in higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is insufficient understanding of influencing factors predicting student satisfaction for this novel learning environment in crisis. The present study investigated important predictors in determining the satisfaction of undergraduate students (N = 425) from multiple departments in using ERL at a self-funded university in Hong Kong while Moodle and Microsoft Team are the key learning tools. By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores. The results suggest that the need of reviewing the quality and quantity of modified assessment accommodated for ERL and structured class delivery with the suitable amount of interactive learning according to the learning culture and program nature. © 2021 Ho et al.

contention resolution in wi-fi 6-enabled internet of things based on deep learning,2021.0,5.0,"Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to vastly increase the number of connected devices. As a result, a multitude of IoT devices transmit various information through wireless communication technology, such as the Wi-Fi technology, cellular mobile communication technology, low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology. However, even the latest Wi-Fi technology is still ready to accommodate these large amounts of data. Accurately setting the contention window (CW) value significantly affects the efficiency of the Wi-Fi network. Unfortunately, the standard collision resolution used by IEEE 802.11ax networks is nonscalable; thus, it cannot maintain stable throughput for an increasing number of stations, even when Wi-Fi 6 has been designed to improve performance in dense scenarios. To this end, we propose a CW control strategy for Wi-Fi 6 systems. This strategy leverages deep learning to search for optimal configuration of CW under different network conditions. Our deep neural network is trained by data generated from a Wi-Fi 6 simulation system with some varying key parameters, e.g., the number of nodes, short interframe space (SIFS), distributed interframe space (DIFS), and data transmission rate. Numerical results demonstrated that our deep learning scheme could always find the optimal CW adjustment multiple by adaptively perceiving the channel competition status. The finalized performance of our model has been significantly improved in terms of system throughput, average transmission delay, and packet retransmission rate. This makes Wi-Fi 6 better adapted to the access of a large number of IoT devices. © 2014 IEEE.",Contention window (CW) optimization; deep learning; Internet of Things (IoT); Wi-Fi 6,"Chen C., Li J., Balasubramaniam V., Wu Y., Zhang Y., Wan S.",Article,contention resolution enable internet thing base deep internet thing iot expect vastly increase number connected device result multitude iot device transmit information communication technology technology cellular mobile communication technology low power wide area lpwan technology late technology ready accommodate large amount accurately set contention window cw value significantly affect efficiency unfortunately standard collision resolution 802.11ax nonscalable maintain stable throughput increase number station design improve dense scenario end cw control strategy system strategy leverage deep search optimal configuration cw different condition deep neural train generate simulation vary key parameter e.g. number node short interframe space sif distribute interframe space difs transmission rate numerical result demonstrate deep scheme find optimal cw adjustment multiple adaptively perceive channel competition status finalize model significantly improve term throughput average transmission delay packet retransmission rate make well adapt access large number iot device contention window cw optimization deep internet thing iot
robust computationally-efficient wireless emitter classification using autoencoders and convolutional neural networks,2021.0,0.0,"This paper proposes a novel Deep Learning (DL)-based approach for classifying the radio-access technology (RAT) of wireless emitters. The approach improves computational efficiency and accuracy under harsh channel conditions with respect to existing approaches. Intelligent spectrum monitoring is a crucial enabler for emerging wireless access environments that supports sharing of (and dynamic access to) spectral resources between multiple RATs and user classes. Emitter classification enables monitoring the varying patterns of spectral occupancy across RATs, which is instrumental in optimizing spectral utilization and interference management and supporting efficient enforcement of access regulations. Existing emitter classification approaches successfully leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize RAT visual features in spectrograms and other time-frequency representations; however, the corresponding classification accuracy degrades severely under harsh propagation conditions, and the computational cost of CNNs may limit their adoption in resource-constrained network edge scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel emitter classification solution consisting of a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), which feeds a CNN classifier with lower di-mensionality, denoised representations of channel-corrupted spectrograms. We demonstrate—using a standard-compliant simulation of various RATs including LTE and four latest Wi-Fi standards—that in harsh channel conditions including non-line-of-sight, large scale fading, and mobility-induced Doppler shifts, our proposed solution outperforms a wide range of standalone CNNs and other machine learning models while requiring significantly less computational resources. The maximum achieved accuracy of the emitter classifier is 100%, and the average accuracy is 91% across all the propagation conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

deepseg: deep-learning-based activity segmentation framework for activity recognition using wifi,2021.0,3.0,"Due to its nonintrusive character, WiFi channel state information (CSI)-based activity recognition has attracted tremendous attention in recent years. Since activity recognition performance heavily relies on activity segmentation results, a number of activity segmentation methods have been designed, and most of them focus on seeking optimal thresholds to segment activities. However, these threshold-based methods are strongly dependent on designers' experience and might suffer from performance decline when applying to the scenario, including both fine-grained and coarse-grained activities. To address these challenges, we present DeepSeg, a deep learning-based activity segmentation framework for activity recognition using WiFi signals. In this framework, we transform segmentation tasks into classification problems and propose a CNN-based activity segmentation algorithm, which can reduce the dependence on experience and address the performance degradation problem. To further enhance the overall performance, we design a feedback mechanism, where the segmentation algorithm is refined based on the feedback computed using activity recognition results. The experiments demonstrate that DeepSeg acquires remarkable gains compared with state-of-the-art approaches. © 2014 IEEE.",Activity recognition; change point detection (CPD); channel state information (CSI); segmentation; time series,"Xiao C., Lei Y., Ma Y., Zhou F., Qin Z.",Article,deepseg deep base activity segmentation framework activity recognition nonintrusive character channel state information csi)-base activity recognition attract tremendous attention recent year activity recognition heavily rely activity segmentation result number activity segmentation method design focus seek optimal threshold segment activity threshold base method strongly dependent designer experience suffer decline apply scenario include fine grain coarse grain activity address challenge present deepseg deep base activity segmentation framework activity recognition signal framework transform segmentation task classification problem cnn base activity segmentation algorithm reduce dependence experience address degradation problem enhance overall design feedback mechanism segmentation algorithm refine base feedback compute activity recognition result experiment demonstrate deepseg acquire remarkable gain compare state art approach activity recognition change point detection cpd channel state information csi segmentation time series
a generative method for indoor localization using wi-fi fingerprinting,2021.0,1.0,"Indoor localization is an enabling technology for pervasive and mobile computing applications. Although different technologies have been proposed for indoor localization, Wi-Fi fingerprinting is one of the most used techniques due to the pervasiveness of Wi-Fi technology. Most Wi-Fi fingerprinting localization methods presented in the literature are discriminative methods. We present a generative method for indoor localization based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The Received Signal Strength Indicator received from a Wireless Access Point is modeled by a hidden Markov model. Unlike other algorithms, the use of a hidden Markov model allows ours to take advantage of the temporal autocorrelation present in the Wi-Fi signal. The algorithm estimates the user’s location based on the hidden Markov model, which models the signal and the forward algorithm to determine the likelihood of a given time series of Received Signal Strength Indicators. The proposed method was compared with four other well-known Machine Learning algorithms through extensive experimentation with data collected in real scenarios.

low-cost and device-free human activity recognition based on hierarchical learning model,2021.0,2.0,"Human activity recognition (HAR) has been a vital human–computer interaction service in smart homes. It is still a challenging task due to the diversity and similarity of human actions. In this paper, a novel hierarchical deep learning-based methodology equipped with low-cost sensors is proposed for high-accuracy device-free human activity recognition. ESP8266, as the sensing hardware, was utilized to deploy the WiFi sensor network and collect multi-dimensional received signal strength indicator (RSSI) records. The proposed learning model presents a coarse-to-fine hierarchical classification framework with two-level perception modules. In the coarse-level stage, twelve statistical features of time–frequency domains were extracted from the RSSI measurements filtered by a butterworth low-pass filter, and a support vector machine (SVM) model was employed to quickly recognize the basic human activities by classifying the signal statistical features. In the fine-level stage, the gated recurrent unit (GRU), a representative type of recurrent neural network (RNN), was applied to address issues of the confused recognition of similar activities. The GRU model can realize automatic multi-level feature extraction from the RSSI measurements and accurately discriminate the similar activities. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved recognition accuracies of 96.45% and 94.59% for six types of activities in two different environments and performed better compared the traditional pattern-based methods.

device-free single-user activity recognition using diversified deep ensemble learning,2021.0,3.0,"WiFi-based human activity recognition (HAR) aims to recognize human activities in an off-the-shelf manner that only relies on the commercial Wi-Fi devices already installed in environments. The recent trend in HAR research is to train classifiers on top of statistical or deep neural features extracted from channel state information (CSI) data. Unfortunately, existing methods only take into account the temporal-correlation within each CSI subcarrier, while ignoring the spatial-correlation between different subcarriers. This issue has not been fully exploited yet, resulting a limited performance. To address this issue, we propose WiAReS, a WiFi-based device-free activity recognition system that takes both temporal-correlation and spatial-correlation into account. WiAReS embarks on diversified deep ensemble methods 2̌for single-user activity recognition where one user performs a single activity at a given time. More specifically, it adopts convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extract features from CSI measurements with the preservation of the locality of both spatial patterns and temporal patterns. To further improve recognition accuracy upon CNN-extracted features, we propose a novel ensemble architecture that fuses a multiple layer perception (MLP), a random forest (RF) and a support vector machine (SVM). Our system obtains the CSI data in PHY layer of off-the-shelf WiFi devices by installing Atheros-CSI-Tool on AR9590 based WiFi network interface cards (NICs). Comprehensive experiments have been conducted in three real environments with environmental variation to evaluate the performance of the proposed WiAReS.

In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), fingerprint based localization methods estimate the target location by using a pattern matching model for the measurements of the Received Signal Strength (RSS) from the available transmitter sensors, which are collected by a smartphone with internal sensors. Due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the fingerprint database needs to be updated, periodically. Hence, it is better to add new fingerprint data to the primary database in order to update them. However, collecting the labeled data is time consuming and labor intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, which uses high level extracted features by an autoencoder to improve the localization performance in the classification process. Furthermore, to update the fingerprint data base, we also add crowd-sourced labeled and unlabeled data in order to improve the localization performance, gradually. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method provides a significant improvement in localization performance, using high level extracted features by the autoencoder, and by increasing the number of unlabeled training data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Autoencoder; Deep extreme learning machine; Fingerprint; Indoor localization; Semi-supervised; Wireless sensor network,"Ezzati Khatab Z., Hajihoseini Gazestani A., Ghorashi S.A., Ghavami M.",Article,fingerprint indoor localization autoencod base semi supervised deep extreme machine recent year grow demand location base service indoor environment development fingerprint base indoor localization attract researcher sensor wsns fingerprint base localization method estimate target location pattern matching model measurement receive signal strength rss available transmitter sensor collect smartphone internal sensor dynamic nature environment fingerprint database need update periodically well add new fingerprint primary database order update collect label time consume labor intensive novel algorithm use high level extract feature autoencoder improve localization classification process furthermore update fingerprint add crowd source label unlabele order improve localization gradually simulation result indicate propose provide significant improvement localization high level extract feature autoencoder increase number unlabele training elsevi b.v autoencoder deep extreme machine fingerprint indoor localization semi supervised sensor
maps: indoor localization algorithm based on multiple ap selection,2021.0,1.0,"In recent years, indoor fingerprint-based localization algorithm has been widely used by applications on smart phone. In these localization algorithms, it’s very popular to use WiFi signal characteristics to represent the location fingerprint. With the fast popularization of WiFi, the WiFi access points (APs) could be seen everywhere. However, as the number of APs increases, the dimension of the fingerprint and the complexity of fingerprint-based localization algorithm subsequently increase. Responding to the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel indoor localization algorithm MAPS (indoor localization algorithm based on multiple access point selection). MAPS could effectively reduce the complexity of localization computation, and improve the performance of localization through AP selection method. With the first round AP selection, MAPS can obtain a stable subset of AP, thus reducing the dimension of fingerprint, and obtaining better discrimination. And with the second round of AP selection, AP subset could be further condensed to construct a decision tree in each location cluster. This step can further improve the localization performance. The experimental results shown, as compared with classical indoor localization algorithm, MAPS has better positioning accuracy, and could achieve the accuracy of over 90% within 2m location error. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Decision tree; K-means; Location cluster; Location fingerprint; Multiple AP selection,"Huang P., Zhao H., Liu W., Jiang D.",Article,map indoor localization algorithm base multiple ap selection recent year indoor fingerprint base localization algorithm widely application smart phone localization algorithm popular use signal characteristic represent location fingerprint fast popularization access point aps see number ap increase dimension fingerprint complexity fingerprint base localization algorithm subsequently increase respond challenge propose novel indoor localization algorithm map indoor localization algorithm base multiple access point selection map effectively reduce complexity localization computation improve localization ap selection round ap selection map obtain stable subset ap reduce dimension fingerprint obtain well discrimination second round ap selection ap subset condense construct decision tree location cluster step improve localization experimental result show compare classical indoor localization algorithm map well positioning accuracy achieve accuracy m location error springer science+business medium llc springer nature decision tree k mean location cluster location fingerprint multiple ap selection
crossgr: accurate and low-cost cross-target gesture recognition using wi-fi,2021.0,1.0,"This paper focuses on a fundamental question in Wi-Fi-based gesture recognition: ""Can we use the knowledge learned from some users to perform gesture recognition for others?"". This problem is also known as cross-target recognition. It arises in many practical deployments of Wi-Fi-based gesture recognition where it is prohibitively expensive to collect training data from every single user. We present CrossGR, a low-cost cross-target gesture recognition system. As a departure from existing approaches, CrossGR does not require prior knowledge (such as who is currently performing a gesture) of the target user. Instead, CrossGR employs a deep neural network to extract user-agnostic but gesture-related Wi-Fi signal characteristics to perform gesture recognition. To provide sufficient training data to build an effective deep learning model, CrossGR employs a generative adversarial network to automatically generate many synthetic training data from a small set of real-world examples collected from a small number of users. Such a strategy allows CrossGR to minimize the user involvement and the associated cost in collecting training examples for building an accurate gesture recognition system. We evaluate CrossGR by applying it to perform gesture recognition across 10 users and 15 gestures. Experimental results show that CrossGR achieves an accuracy of over 82.6% (up to 99.75%). We demonstrate that CrossGR delivers comparable recognition accuracy, but uses an order of magnitude less training samples collected from the end-users when compared to state-of-the-art recognition systems. © 2021 ACM.",Cross-target; Deep Learning; Gesture Recognition; Wi-Fi; Wireless Sensing,"Li X., Chang L., Song F., Wang J., Chen X., Tang Z., Wang Z.",Article,crossgr accurate low cost cross target gesture recognition focus fundamental question base gesture recognition use knowledge learn user perform gesture recognition problem know cross target recognition arise practical deployment base gesture recognition prohibitively expensive collect training single user present crossgr low cost cross target gesture recognition departure exist approach crossgr require prior knowledge currently perform gesture target user instead crossgr employ deep neural extract user agnostic gesture relate signal characteristic perform gesture recognition provide sufficient training build effective deep model crossgr employ generative adversarial automatically generate synthetic training small set real world example collect small number user strategy allow crossgr minimize user involvement associate cost collect training example build accurate gesture recognition evaluate crossgr apply perform gesture recognition user gesture experimental result crossgr achieve accuracy 82.6 99.75 demonstrate crossgr deliver comparable recognition accuracy use order magnitude training sample collect end user compare state art recognition system acm cross target deep gesture recognition sense

securing zigbee communications against constant jamming attack using neural network,2021.0,2.0,"ZigBee is a wireless communication technology that has been widely used to provide low-bandwidth wireless services for Internet-of-Things applications, such as building automation, medical data collection, and industrial equipment control. As ZigBee operates in the industrial, scientific and medical radio frequency bands, it may suffer from unintentional interference from coexisting radio devices (e.g., WiFi and Bluetooth) and/or radio jamming attacks from malicious devices. Although many results have been produced to enhance ZigBee security, there is no technique that can secure ZigBee against jamming attack. In this article, we propose a new ZigBee receiver by leveraging MIMO technology, which is capable of decoding its desired signal in the presence of constant jamming attack. The enabler is a learning-based jamming mitigation method, which can mitigate the unknown interference using an optimized neural network. We have built a prototype of our proposed ZigBee receiver on a wireless testbed. Experimental results show that it is capable of decoding its packets in the face of 20-dB stronger jamming. The proposed ZigBee receiver offers an average of 26.7-dB jamming mitigation capability compared to off-The-shelf ZigBee receivers. © 2014 IEEE.",Internet-of-Things (IoT) communications; jamming and anti-jamming attack; physical-layer security; ZigBee networks,"Pirayesh H., Kheirkhah Sangdeh P., Zeng H.",Article,secure zigbee communication constant jamming attack neural zigbee communication technology widely provide low bandwidth service internet thing application build automation medical collection industrial equipment control zigbee operate industrial scientific medical radio frequency band suffer unintentional interference coexist radio device e.g. bluetooth and/or radio jamming attack malicious device result produce enhance zigbee security secure zigbee jamming attack article new zigbee receiver leverage mimo technology capable decode desire signal presence constant jamming attack enabler base jamming mitigation mitigate unknown interference optimize neural build prototype propose zigbee receiver testbe experimental result capable decode packet face db strong jamming propose zigbee receiver offer average 26.7 db jamming mitigation capability compare shelf zigbee receiver internet thing iot communication jamming anti jamming attack physical layer security zigbee
data augmentation and dense-lstm for human activity recognition using wifi signal,2021.0,11.0,"Recent research has devoted significant efforts on the utilization of WiFi signals to recognize various human activities. An individual's limb motions in the WiFi coverage area could interfere with wireless signal propagation, that manifested as unique patterns for activity recognition. Existing approaches though yielding reasonable performance in certain cases, are ignorant of two major challenges. The performed activities of the individual normally have inconsistent speed in different situations and time. Besides that the wireless signal reflected by human bodies normally carries substantial information that is specific to that subject. The activity recognition model trained on a certain individual may not work well when being applied to predict another individual's activities. Since only recording activities of limited subjects in a certain speed and scale, recent works commonly have a moderate amount of activity data for training the recognition model. The small-size data could often incur the overfitting issue that negative affect the traditional classification model. To address these challenges, we propose a WiFi-based human activity recognition system that synthesizes variant activities data through eight channel state information (CSI) transformation methods to mitigate the impact of activity inconsistency and subject-specific issues, and also design a novel deep-learning model that caters to the small-size WiFi activity data. We conduct extensive experiments and show synthetic data improve performance by up to 34.6% and our system achieves around 90% of accuracy with well robustness in adapting to small-size CSI data. © 2014 IEEE.",Channel state information (CSI); data augmentation; human activity recognition; neural network; WiFi,"Zhang J., Wu F., Wei B., Zhang Q., Huang H., Shah S.W., Cheng J.",Article,augmentation dense lstm human activity recognition signal recent devote significant effort utilization signal recognize human activity individual limb motion coverage area interfere signal propagation manifest unique pattern activity recognition exist approach yield reasonable certain case ignorant major challenge perform activity individual normally inconsistent speed different situation time signal reflect human body normally carry substantial information specific subject activity recognition model train certain individual work apply predict individual activity record activity limited subject certain speed scale recent work commonly moderate activity train recognition model small size incur overfitte issue negative affect traditional classification model address challenge base human activity recognition synthesize variant activity channel state information csi transformation method mitigate impact activity inconsistency subject specific issue design novel deep model cater small size activity conduct extensive experiment synthetic improve 34.6 achieve accuracy robustness adapt small size csi channel state information csi augmentation human activity recognition neural
an enhanced smartphone indoor positioning scheme with outlier removal using machine learning,2021.0,0.0,"In smartphone indoor positioning, owing to the strong complementarity between pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and WiFi, a hybrid fusion scheme of them is drawing more and more attention. However, the outlier of WiFi will easily degrade the performance of the scheme, to remove them, many researches have been proposed such as: improving the WiFi individually or enhancing the scheme. Nevertheless, due to the inherent received signal strength (RSS) variation, there still exist some unremoved outliers. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the first outlier detection and removal strategy with the aid of Machine Learning (ML), so called WiFi-AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting), based on the extracted positioning characteristics of WiFi when the pedestrian is static. Then, the paper proposes the second outlier detection and removal strategy, so called WiFi-Chain, based on the extracted positioning characteristics of WiFi, PDR, and their complementary characteristics when the pedestrian is walking. Finally, a hybrid fusion scheme is proposed, which integrates the two proposed strategies, WiFi, PDR with an inertial-navigation-system-based (INS-based) attitude heading reference system (AHRS) via Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The experiment results show that the two proposed strategies are effective and robust. With WiFi-AGNES, the minimum percentage of the maximum error (MaxE) is reduced by 66.5%; with WiFi-Chain, the MaxE of WiFi is less than 4.3 m; further the proposed scheme achieves the best performance, where the root mean square error (RMSE) is 1.43 m. Moreover, since characteristics are universal, the proposed scheme integrated the two characteristic-based strategies also possesses strong robustness. © 2021 by the authors.

To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we designed a one- dimensional parallel long short-term memory-fully convolutional network (LSTM-FCN) model to extract gesture features of different dimensions. LSTM can learn complex time dynamic information, whereas FCN can predict gestures efficiently by extracting the deep, abstract features of gestures in the spatial dimension. In the experiment, 50 types of gestures of five users were collected and evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this system and robustness to various gestures and individual changes. Statistical analysis of the recognition results indicated that an average accuracy of approximately 98.9% was achieved. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.",deep learning; gesture recognition; parallel LSTM-FCN neural network; signal and information processing; wireless channel state information,"Tang Z., Liu Q., Wu M., Chen W., Huang J.",Article,csi gesture recognition base parallel lstm fcn deep space time neural develop base deep space time neural gesture recognition user change number gesture category increase accuracy gesture recognition decrease considerably gesture recognition system accommodate user differentiation gesture diversity overcome limitation exist method design one- dimensional parallel long short term memory fully convolutional lstm fcn model extract gesture feature different dimension lstm complex time dynamic information fcn predict gesture efficiently extract deep abstract feature gesture spatial dimension experiment type gesture user collect evaluate experimental result demonstrate effectiveness robustness gesture individual change statistical recognition result indicate average accuracy approximately 98.9 achieve china institute communication deep gesture recognition parallel lstm fcn neural signal information processing channel state information
learning to optimize for resource allocation in lte-u networks,2021.0,0.0,"This paper proposes a deep learning (DL) resource allocation framework to achieve the harmonious coexistence between the transceiver pairs (TPs) and the Wi-Fi users in LTE-U networks. The noncon- vex resource allocation is considered as a constrained learning problem and the deep neural network (DNN) is employed to approximate the optimal resource allocation decisions through unsupervised manner. A parallel DNN framework is proposed to deal with the two optimization variables in this problem, where one is the licensed power allocation unit and the other is the unlicensed time fraction occupied unit. Besides, to guarantee the feasibility of the proposed algorithm, the Lagrange dual method is used to relax the constraints into the DNN training process. Then, the dual variable and the DNN parameter are alternating update via the batch-based gradient decent method until the training process converges. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible and has better performance than other general algorithms. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.",deep learning; LTE-U networks; resource allocation; Wi-Fi system,"Chai G., Wu W., Yang Q., Liu R., Kwak K.S.",Article,optimize resource allocation lte u propose deep dl resource allocation framework achieve harmonious coexistence transceiver pair tps user lte u noncon- vex resource allocation consider constrained problem deep neural dnn employ approximate optimal resource allocation decision unsupervised manner parallel dnn framework propose deal optimization variable problem license power allocation unit unlicensed time fraction occupy unit guarantee feasibility propose algorithm lagrange dual relax constraint dnn training process dual variable dnn parameter alternate update batch base gradient decent training process converge numerical result propose algorithm feasible well general algorithm china institute communication deep lte u resource allocation

estimating pqos of video conferencing on wi‐fi networks using machine learning,2021.0,1.0,"Video conferencing services based on web real‐time communication (WebRTC) protocol are growing in popularity among Internet users as multi‐platform solutions enabling interactive communication from anywhere, especially during this pandemic era. Meanwhile, Internet service providers (ISPs) have deployed fiber links and customer premises equipment that operate according to recent 802.11ac/ax standards and promise users the ability to establish uninterrupted video conferencing calls with ultra‐high‐definition video and audio quality. However, the best‐effort nature of 802.11 networks and the high variability of wireless medium conditions hinder users experienc-ing uninterrupted high‐quality video conferencing. This paper presents a novel approach to esti-mate the perceived quality of service (PQoS) of video conferencing using only 802.11‐specific network performance parameters collected from Wi‐Fi access points (APs) on customer premises. This study produced datasets comprising 802.11‐specific network performance parameters collected from off‐the‐shelf Wi‐Fi APs operating at 802.11g/n/ac/ax standards on both 2.4 and 5 GHz fre-quency bands to train machine learning algorithms. In this way, we achieved classification accura-cies of 92–98% in estimating the level of PQoS of video conferencing services on various Wi‐Fi net-works. To efficiently troubleshoot wireless issues, we further analyzed the machine learning model to correlate features in the model with the root cause of quality degradation. Thus, ISPs can utilize the approach presented in this study to provide predictable and measurable wireless quality by implementing a non‐intrusive quality monitoring approach in the form of edge computing that preserves customers’ privacy while reducing the operational costs of monitoring and data analytics. © 2021 by the authors.

"an overview on position location: past, present, future",2021.0,3.0,"Prior to the 21st century, positioning technologies had limited applications including air traffic control, air and sea navigation, satellite communications and related military uses. Today, positioning technologies have deeply merged with daily life and enabled many novel sensors, systems and services. For example, navigation systems are the enablers of road traffic prediction, assisted and autonomous driving, and several aspects of healthcare. They have also facilitated worldwide services provided by companies such as Uber and Lyft. In fact, in many aspects of modern life, localization systems are deemed essential to day-to-day living and are contributing to our general well-being, the economy, and security. Accordingly, position location technologies have become key components of many worldwide industries. These positioning technologies include the Global Positioning System (GPS), WiFi-based indoor localization, cell-phone based localization (including the fusion of GPS, cell-tower based localization and dead-reckoning), and inertial/dead-reckoning techniques. Tracking technologies are also considered key components for localization, as are the more recently integrated concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

a survey of machine learning techniques for indoor localization and navigation systems,2021.0,6.0,"In the recent past, we have witnessed the adoption of different machine learning techniques for indoor positioning applications using WiFi, Bluetooth and other technologies. The techniques range from heuristically derived hand-crafted feature-based traditional machine learning algorithms, feature selection algorithms to the hierarchically self-evolving feature-based Deep Learning algorithms. The transient and chaotic nature of the WiFi/Bluetooth fingerprint data along with different signal sensitivity of different device configurations presents numerous challenges that influence the performance of the indoor localization system in the wild. This article is intended to offer a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey on machine learning techniques that have recently been adopted for localization purposes. Hence, we review the applicability of machine learning techniques in this domain along with basic localization principles, applications, and the underlying problems and challenges associated with the existing systems.

crisloc: reconstructable csi fingerprinting for indoor smartphone localization,2021.0,5.0,"Channel-state information (CSI)-based fingerprinting for WIFI indoor localization has attracted lots of attention very recently. The frequency diverse and temporally stable CSI better represents the location-dependent channel characteristics than the coarse received signal strength (RSS). However, the acquisition of CSI requires the cooperation of access points (APs) and involves only data frames, which imposes restrictions on real-world deployment. In this article, we present CRISLoc, the first CSI fingerprinting-based localization prototype system using ubiquitous smartphones. CRISLoc operates in a completely passive mode, overhearing the packets on-the-fly for his own CSI acquisition. The smartphone CSI is sanitized via calibrating the distortion enforced by WiFi amplifier circuits. CRISLoc tackles the challenge of altered APs with a joint clustering and outlier detection method to find them. A novel transfer learning approach is proposed to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI fingerprint database on the basis of the outdated fingerprints and a few fresh measurements, and an enhanced KNN approach is proposed to pinpoint the location of a smartphone. Our study reveals important properties about the stability and sensitivity of smartphone CSI that has not been reported previously. Experimental results show that CRISLoc can achieve a mean error of around 0.29 m in a 6 m times 8 m research laboratory. The mean error increases by 5.4 and 8.6 cm upon the movement of one and two APs, which validates the robustness of CRISLoc against environmental changes. © 2014 IEEE.",Channel-state information (CSI); fingerprinting; localization; smartphone; transfer learning,"Gao Z., Gao Y., Wang S., Li D., Xu Y.",Article,crisloc reconstructable csi fingerprinting indoor smartphone localization channel state information csi)-base fingerprinting indoor localization attract lot attention recently frequency diverse temporally stable csi well represent location dependent channel characteristic coarse receive signal strength rss acquisition csi require cooperation access point aps involve frame impose restriction real world deployment article present crisloc csi fingerprinting base localization prototype ubiquitous smartphone crisloc operate completely passive mode overhear packet fly csi acquisition smartphone csi sanitize calibrate distortion enforce amplifier circuit crisloc tackle challenge alter aps joint clustering outlier detection find novel transfer approach propose reconstruct high dimensional csi fingerprint database basis outdated fingerprint fresh measurement enhanced knn approach propose pinpoint location smartphone reveal important property stability sensitivity smartphone csi report previously experimental result crisloc achieve mean error 0.29 m m time m laboratory mean error increase 5.4 8.6 cm movement ap validate robustness crisloc environmental change channel state information csi fingerprinting localization smartphone transfer

filter combination learning for cnn model compression,2021.0,0.0,"In this paper, we propose a new method for generating convolution filters of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model as linear combinations of only a few basis filters that are provided as input features. In our approach, best coefficients of the linear combinations are searched (trained) with the given input basis filters (IBFs) to reconstruct the convolution filter parameters. Since all the convolution filters can be generated by the linear combinations of the IBFs, the size of a CNN model can be compressed if the number of coefficients for the linear combinations is less than that of filter parameters. Our primary goal is to investigate the possibility of expressing filters with a small set of IBFs by linear combinations. The second goal is to compress a model so that it can be beneficial when the model is distributed and stored (particularly downloaded to mobile devices through Wi-Fi). © 2021 The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS)",Deep learning; Filter combination; Model compression,"Jeong J., Cho J.-H., Lee J.-G.",Article,filter combination cnn model compression new generate convolution filter convolutional neural cnn model linear combination basis filter provide input feature approach good coefficient linear combination search train give input basis filter ibfs reconstruct convolution filter parameter convolution filter generate linear combination ibfs size cnn model compress number coefficient linear combination filter parameter primary goal investigate possibility express filter small set ibfs linear combination second goal compress model beneficial model distribute store particularly download mobile device korean institute communication information science kic deep filter combination model compression
a new wi-fi dynamic selection of nearest neighbor localization algorithm based on rss characteristic value extraction by hybrid filtering,2021.0,1.0,"Fingerprinting localization based on Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) is the most widely used indoor localization method. It typically includes offline training and online matching phases. The selection of the RSS characteristic value is a key step. The weighted K nearest neighbor (WKNN) algorithm is the most commonly used position-determination algorithm. The mean value of the RSS data collected over a time interval is usually taken as its characteristic value. However, the RSS measurements contain Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, which cannot be filtered out effectively by the mean value method. The traditional WKNN algorithm adopts a fixed K. However, reference points far away from the test point (TP) may be selected as the nearest neighbors to participate in the position calculation, which may result in accuracy degradation. This paper proposes the weighted dynamic K nearest neighbor algorithm (WDKNN-HF), which utilizes a hybrid of particle filtering and Kalman filtering to extract the RSS characteristic value. In the online matching phase, a dynamic K matching algorithm based on Euclidean distances is developed to determine the coordinates of TPs. Two experiments are conducted in two different indoor scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain better positioning accuracy than existing algorithms, such as KNN, WKNN, enhanced-WKNN (EWKNN) and self-adaptive weighted K nearest neighbor (SAWKNN). © 2020 The Author(s).

open set wireless transmitter authorization: deep learning approaches and dataset considerations,2021.0,2.0,"Due to imperfections in transmitters' hardware, wireless signals can be used to verify their identity in an authorization system. While deep learning was proposed for transmitter identification, existing work has mainly focused on classification among a closed set of transmitters. Malicious transmitters outside this closed set will be misclassified, jeopardizing the authorization system. In this article, we formulate the problem of recognizing authorized transmitters and rejecting new transmitters as open set recognition and anomaly detection. We consider approaches based on one and several binary classifiers, multiclass classifiers, and signal reconstruction. We study how these approaches scale with the required number of authorized transmitters. We propose using a known set of unauthorized transmitters to assist the training and study its impact.

wids: an anomaly based intrusion detection system for wi-fi (ieee 802.11) protocol,2021.0,4.0,"Over the last few decades, the Internet has seen unprecedented growth, with over 4.57 billion active users as of July 2022, encompassing 59% of the global population. In recent years, we have seen an increase in mobile computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), allowing more users to communicate through the Internet using wireless devices. Modern Internet users use their wireless IoT devices for a wide variety of services that include cloud computing and storage, social networking, content services, online banking, shopping, to name a few. Moreover, with the omnipresence of IoT devices, wireless networks are used for services like device control, user authentication, etc. Wi-Fi is the network of choice for most of these wireless communications. Although Wi-Fi networks have improved over recent years, little has been done to secure Wi-Fi networks against attacks. In this article, we present a Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS); an anomaly behavior analysis approach to detect attacks on Wi-Fi networks with high accuracy and low false alarms. In this approach, we model the normal behavior of the Wi-Fi protocol, using n-grams, and use machine learning models to classify Wi-Fi traffic flows as normal or malicious. We have extensively tested our approach on multiple datasets collected locally at the University of Arizona and AWID family of datasets. Our approach can successfully detect all attacks on Wi-Fi protocols with low false positives (0.0174) and a varying low rate of false negatives for different attacks. © 2021 IEEE.",Anomaly behavior analysis; IoT security; machine learning; Wi-Fi security,"Satam P., Hariri S.",Article,wid anomaly base intrusion detection 802.11 protocol decade internet see unprecedented growth 4.57 billion active user july encompass global population recent year see increase mobile computing internet thing iot allow user communicate internet device modern internet user use iot device wide variety service include cloud computing storage social networking content service online banking shopping omnipresence iot device service like device control user authentication etc choice communication improve recent year little secure attack article present intrusion detection wid anomaly behavior approach detect attack high accuracy low false alarm approach model normal behavior protocol n gram use machine model classify traffic flow normal malicious extensively test approach multiple dataset collect locally university arizona awid family dataset approach successfully detect attack protocol low false positive 0.0174 vary low rate false negative different attack anomaly behavior iot security machine security

radio access technology characterisation through object detection,2021.0,3.0,"Radio Access Technology (RAT) classification and monitoring are essential for efficient coexistence of different communication systems in shared spectrum. Shared spectrum, including operation in license-exempt bands, is envisioned in the fifth generation of wireless technology (5G) standards (e.g., 3GPP Rel. 16). In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) approach to characterise the spectrum utilisation and facilitate the dynamic access to it. Recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enable us to perform waveform classification by processing spectrograms as images. In contrast to other ML methods that can only provide the class of the monitored RATs, the solution we propose can recognise not only different RATs in shared spectrum, but also identify critical parameters such as inter-frame duration, frame duration, centre frequency, and signal bandwidth by using object detection and a feature extraction module to extract features from spectrograms. We have implemented and evaluated our solution using a dataset of commercial transmissions, as well as in a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) testbed environment. The scenario evaluated was the coexistence of WiFi and LTE transmissions in shared spectrum. Our results show that our approach has an accuracy of 96% in the classification of RATs from a dataset that captures transmissions of regular user communications. It also shows that the extracted features can be precise within a margin of 2%, and can detect above 94% of objects under a broad range of transmission power levels and interference conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Cognitive radio; Dynamic spectrum access; Object detection; Signal detection,"Fonseca E., Santos J.F., Paisana F., DaSilva L.A.",Article,radio access technology characterisation object detection radio access technology rat classification monitoring essential efficient coexistence different communication system share spectrum share spectrum include operation license exempt band envision fifth generation technology g standard e.g. 3gpp rel machine ml approach characterise spectrum utilisation facilitate dynamic access recent advance convolutional neural cnns enable perform waveform classification process spectrogram image contrast ml method provide class monitor rat solution recognise different rat share spectrum identify critical parameter inter frame duration frame duration centre frequency signal bandwidth object detection feature extraction module extract feature spectrogram implement evaluate solution dataset commercial transmission software define radio sdr testbe environment scenario evaluate coexistence lte transmission share spectrum result approach accuracy classification rat dataset capture transmission regular user communication show extract feature precise margin detect object broad range transmission power level interference condition elsevi b.v cognitive radio dynamic spectrum access object detection signal detection

augmented cwt features for deep learning-based indoor localization using wifi rssi data,2021.0,11.0,"Localization is one of the current challenges in indoor navigation research. The conventional global positioning system (GPS) is affected by weak signal strengths due to high levels of signal interference and fading in indoor environments. Therefore, new positioning solutions tailored for indoor environments need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for indoor localization. However, the performance of a deep learning system depends on the quality of the feature representation. This paper introduces two novel feature set extractions based on the continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) of the received signal strength indicators’ (RSSI) data. The two novel CWT feature sets were augmented with additive white Gaussian noise. The first feature set is CWT image-based, and the second is composed of the CWT PSD numerical data that were dimensionally equalized using principal component analysis (PCA). These proposed image and numerical data feature sets were both evaluated using CNN and ANN models with the goal of identifying the room that the human subject was in and estimating the precise location of the human subject in that particular room. Extensive experiments were conducted to generate the proposed augmented CWT feature set and numerical CWT PSD feature set using two analyzing functions, namely, Morlet and Morse. For validation purposes, the performance of the two proposed feature sets were compared with each other and other existing feature set formulations. The accuracy, precision and recall results show that the proposed feature sets performed better than the conventional feature sets used to validate the study. Similarly, the mean localization error generated by the proposed feature set predictions was less than those of the conventional feature sets used in indoor localization. More particularly, the proposed augmented CWT-image feature set outperformed the augmented CWT-PSD numerical feature set. The results also show that the Morse-based feature sets trained with CNN produced the best indoor positioning results compared to all Morlet and ANN-based feature set formulations. © 2021 by the authors.

ccpos: wifi fingerprint indoor positioning system based on cdae-cnn,2021.0,10.0,"WiFi is widely used for indoor positioning because of its advantages such as long trans-mission distance and ease of use indoors.

neighbor oblivious learning (noble) for device localization and tracking,2021.0,0.0,"On-device localization and tracking are increasingly crucial for various applications. Machine learning (ML) techniques are widely adopted along with the rapidly growing amount of data. However, during training, almost none of ML techniques incorporate the known structural information such as floor plan, which can be especially useful in indoor or other structured environments. The problem is incredibly hard because the structural properties are not explicitly available, making most structural learning approaches inapplicable. We study our method through the intuitions from manifold learning. Whereas existing manifold methods utilizes neighborhood information such as Euclidean distances, we quantize the output space to measure closeness on the structure. We propose Neighbor Oblivious Learning (NObLe) and demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on two applications, Wi-Fi-based fingerprint localization and inertial measurement unit(IMU) based device tracking.

deep negative correlation learning for wifi fingerprint positioning [基于深度负相关学习的室内wifi指纹定位技术],2021.0,0.0,"A method based on deep negative correlation learning for WiFi indoor localization is proposed. By adopting the negative correlation learning strategy on autoencoder and regressor modules, this method leads to much diversified decision surface, thus cancelling out the errors from individual models from averaging over all models and resulting in much better generalization ability.

After implementing the negative correlation learning, this method enables the average localization error at the initial state to drop from 1.57 m to 0.77 m.

Five features of signals were selected, and then the three machine learning algorithms of Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machines were used to learn the data laws of signal features. Because the signal strength was affected by the complexity of the environment, a strain function was proposed, which varied with the degree of congestion in the bus. Finally, the error between the average of estimation result and the manual survey was 0.1338. Therefore, the method proposed is suitable for the passenger flow identification of single-swiping buses in small and medium-sized cities, which improves the operational efficiency of buses and reduces the waiting pressure of passengers during the morning and evening rush hours in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

deepwifi: cognitive wifi with deep learning,2021.0,10.0,"We present the DeepWiFi protocol, which hardens the baseline WiFi (IEEE 802.11ac) with deep learning and sustains high throughput by mitigating out-of-network interference. DeepWiFi is interoperable with baseline WiFi and builds upon the existing WiFi's PHY transceiver chain without changing the MAC frame format. Users run DeepWiFi for: i) RF front end processing; ii) spectrum sensing and signal classification; iii) signal authentication; iv) channel selection and access; v) power control; vi) modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptation; and vii) routing. DeepWiFi mitigates the effects of probabilistic, sensing-based, and adaptive jammers. RF front end processing applies a deep learning-based autoencoder to extract spectrum-representative features. Then a deep neural network is trained to classify waveforms reliably as idle, WiFi, or jammer. Utilizing channel labels, users effectively access idle or jammed channels, while avoiding interference with legitimate WiFi transmissions (authenticated by machine learning-based RF fingerprinting) resulting in higher throughput. Users optimize their transmit power for low probability of intercept/detection and their MCS to maximize link rates used by backpressure algorithm for routing. Supported by embedded platform implementation, DeepWiFi provides major throughput gains compared to baseline WiFi and another jamming-resistant protocol, especially when channels are likely to be jammed and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio is low. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",deep learning; dynamic spectrum access; machine learning; RF signal processing; signal authentication; signal classification; WiFi,"Davaslioglu K., Soltani S., Erpek T., Sagduyu Y.E.",Article,deepwifi cognitive deep present deepwifi protocol harden baseline 802.11ac deep sustain high throughput mitigate interference deepwifi interoperable baseline build exist phy transceiver chain change mac frame format user run deepwifi rf end processing ii spectrum sensing signal classification iii signal authentication iv channel selection access v power control vi modulation code scheme mcs adaptation vii routing deepwifi mitigate effect probabilistic sensing base adaptive jammer rf end processing apply deep base autoencoder extract spectrum representative feature deep neural train classify waveform reliably idle jammer utilize channel label user effectively access idle jammed channel avoid interference legitimate transmission authenticate machine base rf fingerprinting result high throughput user optimize transmit power low probability intercept detection mcs maximize link rate backpressure algorithm routing support embed platform implementation deepwifi provide major throughput gain compare baseline jamming resistant protocol especially channel likely jammed signal interference plus noise ratio low deep dynamic spectrum access machine rf signal processing signal authentication signal classification
indoor wi-fi positioning algorithm based on location fingerprint,2021.0,0.0,"Currently most of the existing indoor fingerprint positioning algorithms are based on fingerprint database. The accuracy of the fingerprint database will directly affect the final positioning accuracy. Therefore, through the research of fingerprint data, a method based on skewness-kurtosis normality test and Kalman filter fusion is proposed. In the training phase, the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) samples received on each fingerprint point are tested based on the skewness-kurtosis normality. If the normal distribution model is met, the normal distribution function is used to estimate the probability density of the samples. If not the kernel function will be used. And then the value of the large probability density is taken for Kalman filtering, and finally, the averaged value after filtering is used to establish a high-precision fingerprint database. In the online positioning stage, the weighted KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) is used to estimate the position, and finally, the positioning point is corrected by the fusion of the Levenberg-Marquardt method and the Kalman filter. The optimization of the three stages can improve the positioning accuracy. The simulation results show that the indoor positioning method proposed in this paper has the least number of iterations and the positioning accuracy is improved by 60% compared with the traditional Kalman filtering method. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Kalman filter; Levenberg-Marquardt method; Normal distribution; Probability density,"Cui X., Wang M., Li J., Ji M., Yang J., Liu J., Huang T., Chen H.",Article,indoor positioning algorithm base location fingerprint currently exist indoor fingerprint positioning algorithm base fingerprint database accuracy fingerprint database directly affect final positioning accuracy fingerprint base skewness kurtosis normality test kalman filter fusion propose training phase rssi receive signal strength indication sample receive fingerprint point test base skewness kurtosis normality normal distribution model meet normal distribution function estimate probability density sample kernel function value large probability density take kalman filtering finally average value filtering establish high precision fingerprint database online positioning stage weighted knn k near neighbor estimate position finally positioning point correct fusion levenberg marquardt kalman filter optimization stage improve positioning accuracy simulation result indoor positioning propose number iteration positioning accuracy improve compare traditional kalman filtering springer science+business medium llc springer nature kalman filter levenberg marquardt normal distribution probability density
the blockchain random neural network for cybersecure iot and 5g infrastructure in smart cities,2021.0,15.0,"5G promises much faster Internet transmission rates at minimum latencies with indoor and outdoor coverage in Smart Cities. 5G could potentially replace traditional Wi-Fi for network connectivity and Bluetooth technology for geolocation with a seamless radio coverage and network backbone therefore accelerating new services such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Although Wi-Fi 6 is already in the market designed for IoT applications. New Smart City applications based on Big Data will depend on 5G as a mobile Internet service provider therefore eliminating the need to deploy additional private network infrastructure or mobile networks.

We present a cost-effective system and address a major challenge that the industry faces today-Protocol Compatibility.

where to go? predicting next location in iot environment,2021.0,4.0,"Next location prediction has aroused great interests in the era of internet of things (IoT). With the ubiquitous deployment of sensor devices, e.g., GPS and Wi-Fi, IoT environment offers new opportunities for proactively analyzing human mobility patterns and predicting user’s future visit in low cost, no matter outdoor and indoor. In this paper, we consider the problem of next location prediction in IoT environment via a session-based manner. We suggest that user’s future intention in each session can be better inferred for more accurate prediction if patterns hidden inside both trajectory and signal strength sequences collected from IoT devices can be jointly modeled, which however existing state-of-the-art methods have rarely addressed. To this end, we propose a trajectory and sIgnal sequence (TSIS) model, where the trajectory transition regularities and signal temporal dynamics are jointly embedded in a neural network based model. Specifically, we employ gated recurrent unit (GRU) for capturing the temporal dynamics in the multivariate signal strength sequence. Moreover, we adapt gated graph neural networks (gated GNNs) on location transition graphs to explicitly model the transition patterns of trajectories. Finally, both the low-dimensional representations learned from trajectory and signal sequence are jointly optimized to construct a session embedding, which is further employed to predict the next location. Extensive experiments on two real-world Wi-Fi based mobility datasets demonstrate that TSIS is effective and robust for next location prediction compared with other competitive baselines. © 2020, Higher Education Press.",internet of things; neural networks; next location prediction; signal; trajectory,"Lin H., Liu G., Li F., Zuo Y.",Article,predict location iot environment location prediction arouse great interest era internet thing iot ubiquitous deployment sensor device e.g. gps iot environment offer new opportunity proactively analyze human mobility pattern predict user future visit low cost matter outdoor indoor consider problem location prediction iot environment session base manner suggest user future intention session well infer accurate prediction pattern hide inside trajectory signal strength sequence collect iot device jointly model exist state art method rarely address end trajectory signal sequence tsis model trajectory transition regularity signal temporal dynamic jointly embed neural base model specifically employ gate recurrent unit gru capture temporal dynamic multivariate signal strength sequence adapt gate graph neural gate gnn location transition graph explicitly model transition pattern trajectory finally low dimensional representation learn trajectory signal sequence jointly optimize construct session embed employ predict location extensive experiment real world base mobility dataset demonstrate tsis effective robust location prediction compare competitive baseline high education press internet thing neural location prediction signal trajectory
novel weighted ensemble classifier for smartphone based indoor localization,2021.0,9.0,"Indoor localization systems have the capability to change the way of providing location-based services in a closed environment. Though there is no agreed-upon technology that works best in indoor, WiFi signal is an important alternative as most of such places are covered by WiFi Access Points (APs). In this paper, the problem of indoor localization is investigated from the perspective of expert systems through applying machine learning techniques. The significant variation of WiFi signal strength with ambient conditions as well as device configuration badly affects the localization accuracy. Thus, the fingerprinting effort required to train a localization system subject to context heterogeneity is huge. The uncertainty in localization performance due to varying contexts is hardly investigated in the literature. Consequently, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a weighted ensemble classifier based on Dempster–Shafer belief theory to efficiently handle context heterogeneity. Here, the context is defined in terms of different smartphone configurations used for training and testing the system as well as temporal variation of signals. The method presented here utilizes the Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions to calculate the weights of the base learners in the decision of the ensemble. Belief theory is applied here to handle the inherent uncertainty in WiFi signal variations due to heterogeneous context. Real life experiments are conducted for two datasets, JUIndoorLoc and UJIIndoorLoc at different granularity levels. For JUIndoorLoc, with state-of-the-art classifiers, 86–97% accuracy can be achieved for 10-fold cross-validation. However, when the training context differs from the test conditions, accuracy drops to 62–87%. In such a scenario, the proposed weighted ensemble technique is found to achieve almost 98% localization accuracy when RSSIs, mean and variance of RSSIs are considered as features. The technique can lead to an effective expert system for indoor localization at varying granularity levels. Such systems would be beneficial for pervasive indoor positioning applications as no dedicated infrastructure is needed for positioning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Dempster–Shafer belief theory; Ensemble; Indoor localization; Machine learning; RSSI; WiFi,"Roy P., Chowdhury C., Kundu M., Ghosh D., Bandyopadhyay S.",Article,novel weight ensemble classifier smartphone base indoor localization indoor localization system capability change way provide location base service closed environment agree technology work well indoor signal important alternative place cover access point aps problem indoor localization investigate perspective expert system apply machine technique significant variation signal strength ambient condition device configuration badly affect localization accuracy fingerprint effort require train localization subject context heterogeneity huge uncertainty localization vary context hardly investigate literature consequently main contribution weighted ensemble classifier base dempster shafer belief theory efficiently handle context heterogeneity context define term different smartphone configuration training test temporal variation signal present utilize dempster shafer theory belief function calculate weight learner decision ensemble belief theory apply handle inherent uncertainty signal variation heterogeneous context real life experiment conduct dataset juindoorloc ujiindoorloc different granularity level juindoorloc state art classifier 86–97 accuracy achieve fold cross validation training context differ test condition accuracy drop 62–87 scenario propose weight ensemble find achieve localization accuracy rssis mean variance rssis consider feature lead effective expert indoor localization vary granularity level system beneficial pervasive indoor positioning application dedicated infrastructure need positioning elsevi ltd dempster shafer belief theory ensemble indoor localization machine rssi
smart fusion of multi-sensor ubiquitous signals of mobile device for localization in gnss-denied scenarios,2021.0,1.0,"In order to support indoor and outdoor seamless location-based services (LBS), this paper proposes a smart fusion architecture for combing the ubiquitous signals of the mobile device integrated multi-modal sensors based on deep learning, which can fuse the vision/wireless/inertial information. The core of the fusion architecture is an improved four-layers deep neural network that integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an improved particle filter. In the first place, inspired by creating the RGB-D image, we change the image gray by using a normalized magnetic strength and scale the image intensity by using a normalized WiFi signal strength, which results in a new image named RGB-WM image. Then, homogeneous features are extracted from the RGB-WM image based on the improved CNN for achieving context-awareness. Based on combing the context information, we introduce a new particle filter for fusing different information from multi-modal sensors. In order to evaluate our proposed positioning architecture, we have conducted extensive experiments in four different scenarios including our laboratory, and the campus of our university. Experimental results demonstrate the precision and recall of the RGB-WM image feature is 95.6 and 4.1% respectively. Furthermore, the proposed infrastructure-free fusion architecture reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) of locations in the range of 13.3–55.2% in walking experiments with two smartphones, under two motion conditions, which indicates a superior performance of our proposed image/WiFi/magnetic/inertial fusion architecture over the state-of-the-art with these four localization scenarios.

dynamic phase calibration method for csi-based indoor positioning,2021.0,1.0,"The demand for location-based services (LBS) increases significantly with the development of smart devices. Their built-in WiFi capability makes WiFi-based approaches essential for a range of indoor positioning applications. In such LBS systems, accessing received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and finer-grained channel state information (CSI) is enabled by modifying commodity WiFi devices. Additionally, multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) provide the spatial and frequency diversity to build the fingerprint database with CSI. However, due to hardware and environmental impacts, such systems suffer from phase errors and fingerprint noise. In this paper, a novel phase calibration method is proposed to reduce the fingerprint noise and improve the accuracy of CSI-based indoor positioning systems. The CSI phase of each subcarrier is extracted from the WiFi access points in a multi-antenna wireless network. First, the phase offset is calculated through the conventional method that uses a linear transformation to remove phase errors. Then, a dynamic phase calibration method is introduced to compensate for the phase offset by tracking the anomalous phase difference between each CSI sample and neighboring subcarrier. Finally, a machine learning algorithm is trained to estimate the target position. The performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated by evaluating the prediction rate from a margin of error (MoE) model and calculating the average distance error between the predicted grid and ground truth.

federated self-supervised learning of multisensor representations for embedded intelligence,2021.0,13.0,"Smartphones, wearables, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices produce a wealth of data that cannot be accumulated in a centralized repository for learning supervised models due to privacy, bandwidth limitations, and the prohibitive cost of annotations. Federated learning provides a compelling framework for learning models from decentralized data, but conventionally, it assumes the availability of labeled samples, whereas on-device data are generally either unlabeled or cannot be annotated readily through user interaction. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised approach termed scalogram-signal correspondence learning based on wavelet transform (WT) to learn useful representations from unlabeled sensor inputs as electroencephalography, blood volume pulse, accelerometer, and WiFi channel-state information. Our auxiliary task requires a deep temporal neural network to determine if a given pair of a signal and its complementary view (i.e., a scalogram generated with WT) align with each other, by optimizing a contrastive objective. We extensively assess the quality of learned features with our multiview strategy on diverse public data sets, achieving strong performance in all domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of representations learned from an unlabeled input collection on downstream tasks with training a linear classifier over pretrained network, usefulness in low-data regime, transfer learning, and cross-validation. Our methodology achieves competitive performance with fully supervised networks and it works significantly better than pretraining with autoencoders in both central and federated contexts.

finer-level sequential wifi-based indoor localization,2021.0,3.0,"The WiFi-based indoor localization problem aims to identify the location of a user using the signals received from surrounding wireless access points. A major approach to address this problem is through machine learning algorithms trained on precollected radio maps. However, these approaches either completely ignore the temporal aspects of the problem or the interval between consecutive reference points is too large. Therefore, in this work, we study the application of end-to-end sequence models for finer-level WiFi-based indoor localization. We show that localization task can be formulated as a sequence learning problem by using recurrent neural networks with regression output. The regression output is used to estimate three-dimensional positions and allows the network to easily scale to larger areas. In addition, we present our WiFine dataset containing 290 trajectories sequentially collected at finer-level reference points. The dataset is made publicly available for advancing sequential indoor localization research.

future mobile technology: channel access mechanism for lte-laa using deep learning,2021.0,4.0,"The exponential increase of future mobile phone users is resulting in growth of data traffic which is creating a shortage of the licensed spectrum. the scarcity led to the idea of using the unlicensed channel along with the licensed channel in Long Term Evolution (LTE), known as License Assisted Access (LAA). However, the unlicensed spectrum is already utilized by Wi-Fi and in order to deploy Small Base Stations (SBSs) that will also utilize the same band there is a need for a fair coexistence mechanism which will allow the SBS to be operational without degrading the performance of Wi- Fi. by adopting a deep learning approach, we can train SBSs to predict wireless traffic ahead of time. To forecast future time sequences, we use LSTM models which have already proven to be competent for time series predictions. We tested the LSTM models with high load datasets and a low load dataset that we were able to generate using a 2.4 GHz band. We obtained a RMSE of 0.041463 at the lowest for trace 3 and an MSE of 0.0017192. These results demonstrate the precision of LSTM networks for recognizing wireless traffic patterns.

comparative analysis of travel time prediction algorithms for urban arterials using wi-fi sensor data,2021.0,0.0,"Travel time is one of the elementary traffic stream parameters in both users' and transport planners' perspective. Conventional travel time estimation methods have performed out of sorts for Indian urban traffic conditions characterized by heterogeneity in transport modes and lack of lane discipline. Robust to these limitations, Media Access Control (MAC) matching is perceived to be a reliable alternative for travel time estimation. To assist with real-time traffic control strategies, this study aims at developing a reliable structure for forecasting travel time on Indian urban arterials using data from Wi-Fi/Bluetooth sensors. The data collected on an urban arterial in Chennai has been used as a case study to explain the value of such data and to explore its applicability in implementing various prediction models.

cots drone detection using video streaming characteristics,2021.0,0.0,"Cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) drones have become widely available for consumers in recent years. Unfortunately, they also provide low-cost capabilities for attackers. Therefore, effective methods to detect the presence of non-cooperating rogue drones within a restricted area are highly required. Approaches based on detection of control traffic have been proposed but were not yet shown to work against other benign traffic, such as that generated by wireless security cameras. In this work, we propose a novel drone detection framework based on a Random Forest classification model. In essence, the framework leverages specific patterns in video traffic transmitted by drones. The patterns consist of repetitive synchronization packets (denoted as pivots) which we use as features in the proposed machine learning classifier. We show that our framework can achieve up to 99% detection accuracy over an encrypted WiFi channel using only 20 packets originated from the drone. Our system is able to identify drone transmissions even among very similar WiFi transmission (such as a security camera video stream) and in a noisy scenario with background traffic. © 2021 ACM.",,"Alsoliman A., Rigoni G., Levorato M., Pinotti C., Tippenhauer N.O., Conti M.",Conference Paper,cot drone detection video streaming characteristic cheap commercial shelf cot drone widely available consumer recent year unfortunately provide low cost capability attacker effective method detect presence non cooperate rogue drone restricted area highly require approach base detection control traffic propose show work benign traffic generate security camera work novel drone detection framework base random forest classification model essence framework leverage specific pattern video traffic transmit drone pattern consist repetitive synchronization packet denote pivot use feature propose machine classifier framework achieve detection accuracy encrypt channel packet originate drone able identify drone transmission similar transmission security camera video stream noisy scenario background traffic acm
operator data driven cell-selection in lte-laa coexistence networks,2021.0,3.0,"Efficient cell-selection is essential to realize the gains in network performance promised by LTE Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) in the 5GHz unlicensed band. However, the SINR and transmission power based cell-selection mechanisms employed in LTE HetNets are not suited for LTE-LAA deployments. Further, the impact of cell-association on the performance of the LTE-LAA network and its individual components has not been studied through cellular-operator data. In this work, we address these challenges. We gather a large sample of LTE-LAA deployment data for three cellular operators in the Chicago region, i.e., Austria&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. With the help of operator data, we study the effect of cell-selection on LTE-LAA capacity and network feature relationships through several machine learning techniques. We demonstrate the impact of cell-selection on a combined LTE-LAA system and its licensed and unlicensed components. We show a direct correlation between a cell-quality metric derived from operator data and network performance.

internet of things (iot) based indoor air quality sensing and predictive analytic—a covid-19 perspective,2021.0,8.0,"Indoor air quality typically encompasses the ambient conditions inside buildings and public facilities that may affect both the mental and respiratory health of an individual. Until the COVID-19 outbreak, indoor air quality monitoring was not a focus area for public facilities such as shopping complexes, hospitals, banks, restaurants, educational institutes, and so forth. However, the rapid spread of this virus and its consequent detrimental impacts have brought indoor air quality into the spotlight. In contrast to outdoor air, indoor air is recycled constantly causing it to trap and build up pollutants, which may facilitate the transmission of virus. There are several monitoring solutions which are available commercially, a typical system monitors the air quality using gas and particle sensors. These sensor readings are compared against well known thresholds, subsequently generating alarms when thresholds are violated. However, these systems do not predict the quality of air for future instances, which holds paramount importance for taking timely preemptive actions, especially for COVID-19 actual and potential patients as well as people suffering from acute pulmonary disorders and other health problems. In this regard, we have proposed an indoor air quality monitoring and prediction solution based on the latest Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning capabilities, providing a platform to measure numerous indoor contaminants. For this purpose, an IoT node consisting of several sensors for 8 pollutants including NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, CO2, PM 2.5 along with the ambient temperature &amp; air humidity is developed. For proof of concept and research purposes, the IoT node is deployed inside a research lab to acquire indoor air data. The proposed system has the capability of reporting the air conditions in real-time to a web portal and mobile app through GSM/WiFi technology and generates alerts after detecting anomalies in the air quality. In order to classify the indoor air quality, several machine learning algorithms have been applied to the recorded data, where the Neural Network (NN) model outperformed all others with an accuracy of 99.1%. For predicting the concentration of each air pollutant and thereafter predicting the overall quality of an indoor environment, Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is applied. This model has shown promising results for predicting the air pollutants’ concentration as well as the overall air quality with an accuracy of 99.37%, precision of 99%, recall of 98%, and F1-score of 99%. The proposed solution offers several advantages including remote monitoring, ease of scalability, real-time status of ambient conditions, and portable hardware, and so forth. © 2021 by the authors.

fedpso: federated learning using particle swarm optimization to reduce communication costs,2021.0,3.0,"Federated learning is a learning method that collects only learned models on a server to ensure data privacy. This method does not collect data on the server but instead proceeds with data directly from distributed clients. Because federated learning clients often have limited communication bandwidth, communication between servers and clients should be optimized to improve performance. Federated learning clients often use Wi-Fi and have to communicate in unstable network environments. However, as existing federated learning aggregation algorithms transmit and receive a large amount of weights, accuracy is significantly reduced in unstable network environments. In this study, we propose the algorithm using particle swarm optimization algorithm instead of FedAvg, which updates the global model by collecting weights of learned models that were mainly used in federated learning. The algorithm is named as federated particle swarm optimization (FedPSO), and we increase its robustness in unstable network environments by transmitting score values rather than large weights. Thus, we propose a FedPSO, a global model update algorithm with improved network communication performance, by changing the form of the data that clients transmit to servers. This study showed that applying FedPSO significantly reduced the amount of data used in network communication and improved the accuracy of the global model by an average of 9.47%. Moreover, it showed an improvement in loss of accuracy by approximately 4% in experiments on an unstable network. © 2021 by the authors.

estimating pqos of video streaming on wi-fi networks using machine learning,2021.0,1.0,"Video on demand (VoD) services such as YouTube have generated considerable volumes of Internet traffic in homes and buildings in recent years. While Internet service providers deploy fiber and recent wireless technologies such as 802.11ax to support high bandwidth requirement, the best-effort nature of 802.11 networks and variable wireless medium conditions hinder users from experiencing maximum quality during video streaming. Hence, Internet service providers (ISPs) have an interest in monitoring the perceived quality of service (PQoS) in customer premises in order to avoid customer dissatisfaction and churn. Since existing approaches for estimating PQoS or quality of experience (QoE) requires external measurement of generic network performance parameters, this paper presents a novel approach to estimate the PQoS of video streaming using only 802.11 specific network performance parameters collected from wireless access points. This study produced datasets comprising 802.11n/ac/ax specific network performance parameters labelled with PQoS in the form of mean opinion scores (MOS) to train machine learning algorithms. As a result, we achieved as many as 93-99% classification accuracy in estimating PQoS by monitoring only 802.11 parameters on off-the-shelfWi-Fi access points. Furthermore, the 802.11 parameters used in the machine learning model were analyzed to identify the cause of quality degradation detected on theWi-Fi networks. Finally, ISPs can utilize the results of this study to provide predictable and measurable wireless quality by implementing non-intrusive monitoring of customers’ perceived quality. In addition, this approach reduces customers’ privacy concerns while reducing the operational cost of analytics for ISPs. © 2021 by the authors.

an intelligent hybrid radio access technology selection algorithm for 5g-satellite network,2021.0,0.0,"Cellular networks are anticipated to handle a significant increase in data traffic, as well as a huge number of devices and new use cases in the very near future; therefore, future 5G networks are being built with heterogeneity in mind. The user's device will be able to connect to the network using 5G and other technologies such as LTE, WiMAX, WiFi, Satellite, etc. Satellite Communication (SatCOM), on the other hand, has been proposed as a network of choice to supplement the 5G use cases. In most of 5G's use cases, satellite communication would provide a complimentary service for global coverage, critical communication, broadcast/multicast provision, and multimedia traffic growth. Hence, for these connections to operate effectively, a smooth transmission between 5G and satellite is needed. However, in a heterogeneous wireless network, a major issue is determining how to assign a user to the best Radio Access Technology (RAT). An intelligent hybrid RAT selection algorithm based on machine learning is proposed in this paper. The User Terminal is trained to select the necessary RAT to admit its call using the Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Algorithm. Based on the simulation results, the proposed algorithm has the ability to learn in a competent way to successfully manage resource management autonomously and therefore increases the user's quality of service (QoS).

deep convolution neural network based csi signal classifier to recognize human-human interactions,2021.0,0.0,"In this research, we have proposed a human-human interaction classifier which can classify twelve different interactions (approaching, departing, handshaking, high-five, hugging, kicking with the left leg, kicking with the right leg, pointing with the left hand, pointing with the right hand, punching with the left hand, punching with the right hand, and pushing) using CSI signal. This recognition model consists of three steps: input, feature extraction and recognition. The Feature extraction step utilized DCNNs to automatically extract features from captured CSI signals. It consists of three layers: convolutional layer, batch normalization layer, and rectified linear unit layer. In addition, the recognition phase classifies the extracted features into twelve different classes. It consists of four layers: the flatten layer, fully connected layer, softmax layer, and classification layer. In addition, we have used a Gaussian filter to denoising the CSI signal. To validate the above DCNNs model we have utilized the Chanel State Information (CSI) data obtained from commercial Wi-Fi Access Point and available online. The data set contain the CSI packets that were recorded for forty distinct pairs of subjects while performing twelve different human-human interactions inside an office. Each pair of subjects performed ten different trials of all the interactions. To train and test the proposed model, the train-test split procedure has been employed.

a fuzzy rule-based fog-cloud for control the traffic light duration based on-road density,2021.0,0.0,"A traffic light control system is important to reduce traffic jams. Several methods have been proposed to control traffic lights. However, most of them are inaccurate because do not use data on traffic density status. This study proposes an automatic traffic light control system by instilling artificial intelligence and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology which is used to determine the best duration of traffic lights on an intersection. RFID is used to calculate the average speed of vehicles and the percentage of road occupancy in each lane. The average speed value and the percentage of road occupancy are used as inputs for the fuzzy rule-based algorithm. The outputs of the fuzzy rule-based are the status of traffic jams, road occupancy rate on each lane, the average speed of vehicles on each lane, and real time duration of traffic lights. The fuzzy computing process is carried out locally on the fog server via a Wi-Fi gateway to reduce cloud load. We evaluate the rule-based algorithm on an intersection with 4 lanes.

wi-fi based accurate indoor localization system using svm and lstm algorithms,2021.0,0.0,"Indoor localization of mobile nodes is emerging as a promising field in the past decades due to the advances in mobile devices and the increasing number of wireless services and applications. Wi-Fi fingerprints which is a vector of Received Signal Strength (RSS) values in a specific location are considered a good feature for indoor localization due to their simplicity. However, the existing methods such as decision tree (DT) and Naïve Bayes (NB) techniques have some drawbacks. DT has low efficiency because it uses the Boolean function, and NB provides a low accuracy of prediction for the sparse dataset. In this research, fingerprint referencing with two important methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning algorithms, are used to enable accurate indoor localization. Furthermore, data normalization is implemented to reduce positioning error by increasing the inconsistency of the RSS values. Further, several experiments have been conducted by using three mobile devices in the area of 280 m2to create our dataset by taking 480 RSS records for both training and testing phases. The results show that the accuracy LSTM algorithm is 0.9 m, whereas the SVM algorithm accuracy is 1.1 m.

wi-fi dsar: wi-fi based indoor localization using denoising supervised autoencoder,2021.0,0.0,"In recent years, the demand for Wi-Fi has grown exponentially, which has led to the rapid development of indoor positioning services based on Wi-Fi fingerprints. Due to the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) variation over time, the device heterogeneity, and dynamic changes in the environment, the accuracy and robustness of traditional Wi-Fi fingerprint-based methods usually degrade. To alleviate these issues, we propose an approach based on the denoising supervised autoencoder for regression tasks that we named Wi-Fi DSAR. The idea of Wi-Fi DSAR design is to (a) has strong resistance to the noise in the received Wi-Fi signal, and (b) prevent overfitting the fingerprint database to achieve robustness. We do a performance study by comparing other fingerprint-based works with our Wi-Fi DSAR. All works are evaluated in three open datasets, i.e., DSI, IPIN2016, and IPIN2020, with different area sizes and access point densities. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with existing fingerprint-based methods, our Wi-Fi DSAR is able to reduce the average positioning error by 20% to 50%.

delay-sensitive wireless content delivery: an interpretable artificial intelligence approach,2021.0,0.0,"The COVID-19 emergency has made the consumption of multimedia content skyrocket in all contexts, including education. Many universities leverage hybrid learning models, in which students join a real-time video session via Wi-Fi from several classrooms to ensure safety and social distancing. This is creating a significant strain on the wireless access network, which is required to deliver an unusually high level of traffic. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions have emerged as a way to make networks easier to control and to manage. However, their black box nature and in general their fire and forget approach has generated considerable skepticism over the entire value chain, from vendors to network administrators. This situation has led to a new interest in interpretable AI solutions, which aim at making the decisions taken by AI/ML models intelligible to a domain expert. In this article, we review the concept of interpretable AI and analyze the challenges, requirements, and benefits it can bring to delay-sensitive content delivery in 802.11 Wi-Fi networks.

wce with real time polyp detection and segmentation using deep neural networks,2021.0,0.0,"Capsule robots are developing rapidly. The capsule robots perform non-invasive gastrointestinal endoscopy on patients. With the application of artificial intelligence in the capsule robot, the images collected by the capsule can be read efficiently and accurately offline. However, since the previous capsules either lacked wireless data transmission or only used Bluetooth data transmission, real-time interaction was not yet possible. It is very helpful for the diagnosis of the patient's condition. However, due to the lack of real-time interaction, it is still only an early diagnosis and cannot be applied to real-time treatment. In other words, patients still need to undergo invasive surgery after the gastrointestinal capsule endoscopy. The capsule robot proposed in this paper transmits data through Wi-Fi, detects and locates the lesion in real-time using a deep neural network named SEG-YOLOv5.

machine learning based floor-level sensor positioning in smart buildings,2021.0,0.0,"With the emergence of new technologies, such as 5G, WiFi6, and NB-IoT, sensors are easier to be deployed in smart buildings than before, and more buildings have being built or transformed into smart buildings. Thus, how to track and locate these devices has become a problem. The traditional sensors positioning is achieved by manually recording the position of the sensor or using RSSI measurement. However, these traditional methods suffer from high costs, inaccurate positioning accuracy and high complexity. Different from the traditional sensor positioning algorithm, our design locates the position of sensors by learning the pattern of atmospheric pressure data collected by the sensor. Firstly, we designed the IoT data collection networks which can collect indoor environment data through WiFi, such as light, atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, etc. Secondly, the original data is preprocessed by removing abnormal points, adding missing points and filtering noise. Finally, using the processed data, a restricted Boltzmann machine is applied to obtain the pattern between the atmospheric pressure and floors.

This paper proposes a new indoor localization technique designed for variable loss propagation environments based on deep autoencoder and recurrent neural network (RNN), implemented in three stages. First, we extract statistical feature values from collected RSSI. Second, a deep autoencoder is used to remove wireless propagation noises introduced by variable fading settings. Third, an RNN performs the localization task taking into account previous sensor measurements. Experiments performed in 3 simulated testbeds with distinct propagation loss settings have shown that current approaches decrease localization accuracy by up to 30% when a different propagation loss is faced. In addition, our proposed model improved localization accuracy by up to 25.8% regardless of the current environment propagation loss. © 2021 IEEE.",Deep AutoEncoder; Recurrent Neural Network; WiFi-based indoor localization,"Espindola A., Viegas E.K., Traleski A., Pellenz M.E., Santin A.O.",Conference Paper,deep autoencod rnn model indoor localization variable propagation loss current machine technique indoor localization device assume single propagation loss setting make unfeasible reliable production deployment propose new indoor localization design variable propagation loss environment base deep autoencod recurrent neural rnn implement threefold propose new indoor localization design variable loss propagation environment base deep autoencod recurrent neural rnn implement stage extract statistical feature value collect rssi second deep autoencod remove propagation noise introduce variable fading setting rnn perform localization task take account previous sensor measurement experiment perform simulate testbed distinct propagation loss setting show current approach decrease localization accuracy different propagation loss face addition propose model improve localization accuracy 25.8 regardless current environment propagation loss deep autoencoder recurrent neural base indoor localization
recognition for human gestures based on convolutional neural network using the off-the-shelf wi-fi routers,2021.0,0.0,"Human gestures have been considered as one of the important human-computer interaction modes. With the fast development of wireless technology in urban Internet of Things (IoT) environment, Wi-Fi can not only provide the function of high-speed network communication but also has great development potential in the field of environmental perception. This paper proposes a gesture recognition system based on the channel state information (CSI) within the physical layer of Wi-Fi transmission. To solve the problems of noise interference and phase offset in the CSI, we adopt a model based on CSI quotient. Then, the amplitude and phase curves of CSI are smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter, and the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is used to extract the gesture features. Then, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is adopted to recognize the gestures. The experimental results have shown that our system can achieve a recognition rate of about 90% for three common gestures, including pushing forward, left stroke, and waving. Meanwhile, the effects of different human orientation and model parameters on the recognition results are analyzed as well. Copyright © 2021 Haixia Yang et al.

learning based wi-fi rtt range estimation,2021.0,0.0,"In Wi-Fi RTT range estimation, accuracy is the most critical issue. But current estimated values using Wi-Fi RTT with 802.11mc FTM protocol are often randomly far away from the true range.

cost reduction in fingerprint-based indoor localization using generative adversarial network,2021.0,0.0,"Among the various methods of Wi-Fi localization, fingerprint-based indoor localization is a method with relatively high accuracy. However, it takes a lot of time and labor to initially build an offline database. In particular, as the size of the space increases, the number of reference points to be investigated also increases, so the cost increases proportionally. To solve this problem, a few recent studies have used machine learning to reduce the number of samples collected at each reference point. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the number of reference points that need to be investigated. We collect channel state information (CSI) at a few reference points sparsely and convert it into a CSI amplitude image. Then, the generative adversarial network (GAN) interpolates the values between each reference point by learning these CSI amplitude images and walking in the latent space to synthesize a dense fingerprint map for improved localization accuracy. Our preliminary results show that GAN can create artificial CSI amplitude data that are similar to the actually measured samples for locations in between trained reference points. © 2021 IEEE.",Channel State Information (CSI); Fingerprint-based indoor localization; Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),"Lim C., Paek J.",Conference Paper,cost reduction fingerprint base indoor localization generative adversarial method localization fingerprint base indoor localization relatively high accuracy take lot time labor initially build offline database particular size space increase number reference point investigate increase cost increase proportionally solve problem recent study machine reduce number sample collect reference point reduce number reference point need investigate collect channel state information csi reference point sparsely convert csi amplitude image generative adversarial gan interpolate value reference point csi amplitude image walk latent space synthesize dense fingerprint map improve localization accuracy preliminary result gan create artificial csi amplitude similar actually measure sample location train reference point channel state information csi fingerprint base indoor localization generative adversarial gan
personal hygiene monitoring under the shower using wi-fi channel state information,2021.0,0.0,"Personal hygiene is often used to measure functional independence, which is how much support someone requires to perform self-care. By extension, this is often used in the monitoring of (early-stage) dementia. Current technologies are based on either audiovisual or wearable technologies, both of which have practical limitations. The use of (NLOS) radio-frequency based human activity recognition could provide solutions here. This paper leverages the 802.11n channel state information to monitor different shower-related activities (e.g. washing head or body, brushing teeth, and dressing up) and the degree to which some of these can be monitored, as well estimating different water pressures used while showering for multiple locations in the apartment. Wavelet denoising is applied for filtering and a convolutional neural network is implemented for classification. Results imply that for coarse-grained activity recognition, an F1-score of 0.85 is achievable for certain classes, while for fine-grained this drops to 0.75. Water pressure estimation ranges from 0.75 to 0.85 between fine-grained and coarse-grained, respectively. Overall, this paper shows that channel state information can be successfully employed to monitor variations in different shower activities, as well as successfully estimating the water pressure in the shower.

indoor device-free localization using received signal strength indicator and illuminance sensor for random-forest-based fingerprint technique,2021.0,0.0,"Indoor device-free localization (IDFL) offers more flexibility than conventional indoor localization (device-based) systems, as the targets or objects need not be equipped with any device to be located. In the process of IDFL, the target is passive, enabling applications such as monitoring of elderly people, security systems to detect intruders, and indoor navigation. Despite having more flexibility than device-based systems, IDFL is still inferior in terms of localization performance. The most commonly used technique for IDFL is the fingerprint technique, which uses the uniqueness of spatial information to predict the target's location. The spatial information is a fingerprint database containing information on locations and their corresponding parameters. The most specific parameter for the fingerprint database is the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). RSSI can be obtained directly from many low-cost devices, i.e., Wi-Fi-based devices, without the need to install additional hardware. The fingerprint technique is a two-phase process: The database is constructed in the offline phase, and a matching process to compare the target's current parameter with those in the database is performed in the online phase. We propose fingerprint-technique-based IDFL using RSSI and illumination from an illuminance sensor as the additional parameters of the fingerprint database. Both parameters are recorded by considering two scenarios: An empty room and a person standing in the fingerprint grids. The constructed database is the person-filled room subtracted from the empty room database. We use random forest, one of the machine learning (ML) algorithms, as the pattern-matching algorithm. We evaluate its performance by comparison with two other ML algorithms: K-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and neural networks (NN). The results show that k-NN has better accuracy than the random forest for learning and testing in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE). On the other hand, the random forest has better accuracy than NN and better precision than either k-NN or NN for learning and testing in terms of the standard deviation (STD). The results show the possibility of improving the IDFL performance by adding more parameters to the fingerprint database and using an ML-based pattern-matching algorithm. © 2021 M Y U Scientific Publishing Division.

efficientfi: towards large-scale lightweight wifi sensing via csi compression,2021.0,0.0,"WiFi technology has been applied to various places due to the increasing requirement of high-speed Internet access. Recently, besides network services, WiFi sensing is appealing in smart homes since it is device-free, cost-effective and privacy-preserving. Though numerous WiFi sensing methods have been developed, most of them only consider single smart home scenario. Without the connection of powerful cloud server and massive users, large-scale WiFi sensing is still difficult. In this paper, we firstly analyze and summarize these obstacles, and propose an efficient large-scale WiFi sensing framework, namely EfficientFi. The EfficientFi works with edge computing at WiFi APs and cloud computing at center servers. It consists of a novel deep neural network that can compress fine-grained WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) at edge, restore CSI at cloud, and perform sensing tasks simultaneously. A quantized auto-encoder and a joint classifier are designed to achieve these goals in an end-to-end fashion. To the best of our knowledge, the EfficientFi is the first IoT-cloud-enabled WiFi sensing framework that significantly reduces communication overhead while realizing sensing tasks accurately. We utilized human activity recognition and identification via WiFi sensing as two case studies, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the EfficientFi. The results show that it compresses CSI data from 1.368Mb/s to 0.768Kb/s with extremely low error of data reconstruction and achieves over 98% accuracy for human activity recognition.

To solve the above problems, this paper provides a new perception idea, Wi-Fi imaging human actions, and then using image processing method for action recognition. In the Wi-Fi imaging part, according to the different spatial angles of different parts of the body trunk such as head, chest and legs relative to the receiving end, this paper processes the human body reflection signal received by the receiving end, obtains the signal strength corresponding to each azimuth signal in the space, and generates the human body heat map. In the stage of action recognition, firstly, the background interference is removed. According to the characteristics of imaging and action in this paper, a continuous action segmentation method is proposed. The image action features are obtained through intensive sampling. Finally, the SVM is optimized by genetic algorithm to improve the accuracy of action classification under different conditions.

simhumalator: an open source end-to-end radar simulator for human activity recognition,2021.0,0.0,"Radio-frequency based non-cooperative monitoring of humans has numerous applications ranging from law enforcement to ubiquitous sensing applications such as ambient assisted living and bio-medical applications for non-intrusively monitoring patients. Large training datasets, almost unlimited memory capacity, and ever-increasing processing speeds of computers could drive forward the data-driven deep-learning-focused research in the above applications. However, generating and labeling large volumes of high-quality, diverse radar datasets is an onerous task. Furthermore, unlike the fields of vision and image processing, the radar community has limited access to databases that contain large volumes of experimental data. Therefore, in this article, we present an open-source motion capture data-driven simulation tool, SimHumalator, that can generate large volumes of human micro-Doppler radar data in passive WiFi scenarios.

wifederated: scalable wifi sensing using edge based federated learning,2021.0,0.0,"WiFi sensing using Channel State Information (CSI) offers a device-free and non-intrusive method for human activity monitoring. However, the data-hungry and location-specific training process hinders its scalable deployment at large sizes. In this work, we propose WiFederated, a federated learning (FL) approach to train machine learning models for WiFi sensing tasks. Using WiFederated, client devices can not only perform training in parallel at the edge instead of sequentially at a central server but can also collaboratively learn and share generalizable location-independent traits about physical actions being monitored. We demonstrate that an FL model trained on as few as 2-3 locations can provide high prediction accuracy in new locations even without any data available from them. We also demonstrate how new locations can achieve higher prediction accuracy even with a small number of available samples when using the pretrained FL model rather than training from scratch. The results show that the FL model can save local training epochs and reduce the need for large data collection at each new location. Thus, the proposed WiFederated system scales as more locations are added. We show that WiFederated provides a more accurate and time efficient solution compared to existing transfer learning and adversarial learning solutions thanks to the parallel training ability at multiple clients. By introducing new client selection methods during the FL process, we also show that accuracy can further increase. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of training models at the edge and introduce continuous annotation to allow for continuous learning over time.

cloud-based fault prediction using iot in office automation for improvisation of health of employees,2021.0,1.0,"The novel paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining recognition in the numerous scenarios promoting the pervasive presence of smart things around us through its application in various areas of society, which includes transportation, healthcare, industries, and agriculture. One more such application is in the smart office to monitor the health of devices via machine learning (ML) that makes the equipment more efficient by allowing real-time monitoring of their health. It guarantees indoor comfort as per the user’s satisfaction as it emphasizes on fault prediction in real-life devices. Early identification of various types of faults in IoT devices is the key requirement in smart offices. IoT devices are becoming ubiquitous and provide an assistant to supervise an office that is regulated by ML and data received from sensors is stored in cloud. A recommender system facilitates the selection of an appropriate solution for faults in IoT-enabled devices to mitigate faults.

an efficient intrusion prevention system for can: hindering cyber-attacks with a low-cost platform,2021.0,0.0,"The controller area network (CAN), which is still today the most used in-vehicle network, does not provide any security or authentication mechanism by design. Since current vehicles, which have numerous connectivity technologies, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and cellular radio, can be easily accessed from the exterior world, they can be easy targets of cyber-attacks. It is therefore urgently necessary to enhance vehicle security by detecting and stopping cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised intrusion prevention system (IPS) for automotive CANs that detects and hinders attacks without modifying the architecture of the electronic control units (ECUs) or requiring information that is restricted to car manufacturers. We compare two machine learning algorithms' ability to detect fuzzing and spoofing attacks, and evaluate which of them is most accurate with the fewest number of data bytes. The fewer data bytes required, the sooner detection can start and the sooner attacking frames can be detected. Experiment results show that our proposed detection mechanism achieves accuracy higher than 99%, F1-scores higher than 97%, and detection times shorter than 80 μs for the types of attacks considered. Moreover, when compared to four state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems, it is the only solution that is capable of discarding attacking frames before damage occurs while being deployed on inexpensive Raspberry Pi. Such an inexpensive deployment is particularly desirable, as cost is one of the automotive industry's primary concerns. © 2013 IEEE.",Controller area network (CAN); Intrusion detection system (IDS); Intrusion prevention system (IPS); Machine learning,"Freitas De Araujo-Filho P., Pinheiro A.J., Kaddoum G., Campelo D.R., Soares F.L.",Article,efficient intrusion prevention hinder cyber attack low cost platform controller area today vehicle provide security authentication mechanism design current vehicle numerous connectivity technology bluetooth cellular radio easily access exterior world easy target cyber attack urgently necessary enhance vehicle security detect stop cyber attack novel unsupervised intrusion prevention ips automotive can detect hinder attack modify architecture electronic control unit ecus require information restrict car manufacturer compare machine algorithm ability detect fuzze spoof attack evaluate accurate few number byte few byte require soon detection start soon attack frame detect experiment result propose detection mechanism achieve accuracy high f1 score high detection time short μs type attack consider compare state art intrusion detection system solution capable discard attacking frame damage occur deploy inexpensive raspberry pi inexpensive deployment particularly desirable cost automotive industry primary concern controller area intrusion detection ids intrusion prevention ips machine
indoor positioning system based on standardizing waveform tendency,2021.0,0.0,"Estimating the indoor position of users in commercial buildings remains a significant challenge to date. Although the WiFi-based indoor localization has been widely explored in many works by employing received signal strength (RSS) patterns as the features, they usually lead to inaccurate results as the RSS could be easily affected by the indoor environmental dynamics. Besides, existing methods are computationally intensive, which have a high time consumption that makes them unsuitable for real-life applications. In order to deal with those issues, we propose to use standardizing waveform tendency (SWT) of RSS for indoor positioning. We show that the proposed SWT is robust to the noise generated by the dynamic environment. We further develop a novel smartphone indoor positioning system by integrating SWT and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) algorithm.

csi-ianet: an inception attention network for human-human interaction recognition based on csi signal,2021.0,0.0,"In recent years, Wi-Fi infrastructures have become ubiquitous, providing device-free passive-sensing features. Wi-Fi signals can be affected by their reflection, refraction, and absorption by moving objects in their path. The channel state information (CSI), a signal property indicator, of the Wi-Fi signal can be analyzed for human activity recognition (HAR). Deep learning-based HAR models can enhance performance and accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency. However, to save computational power, an inception network, which uses a variety of techniques to boost speed and accuracy, can be adopted. In contrast, the concept of spatial attention can be applied to obtain refined features. In this paper, we propose a human-human interaction (HHI) classifier, CSI-IANet, which uses a modified inception CNN with a spatial-Attention mechanism. The CSI-IANet consists of three steps: i) data processing, ii) feature extraction, and iii) recognition. The data processing layer first uses the second-order Butterworth low-pass filter to denoise the CSI signal and then segment it before feeding it to the model. The feature extraction layer uses a multilayer modified inception CNN with an attention mechanism that uses spatial attention in an intense structure to extract features from captured CSI signals. Finally, the refined features are exploited by the recognition section to determine HHIs correctly. To validate the performance of the proposed CSI-IANet, a publicly available HHIs CSI dataset with a total of 4800 trials of 12 interactions was used.

h-wps: hybrid wireless positioning system using an enhanced wi-fi ftm/rssi/mems sensors integration approach,2021.0,0.0,"Indoor wireless localization towards the next generation Wi-Fi access point has attracted considerable attention due to the presentation of the state-of-art Wi-Fi Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol. In order to improve the autonomy, accuracy and universality of wireless positioning based on the Internet of Things (IoT) terminals, this paper proposes a hybrid wireless positioning system which contains the integration of Wi-Fi FTM, crowdsourced received signal strength indication (RSSI) fingerprinting and micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) sensors (H-WPS). A light-weight pedestrian aimed inertial navigation system (PINS) is proposed, which contains multi-level constraints and a global optimization model in order to eliminate the cumulative error caused by INS update. A deep-learning based Wi-Fi fingerprinting database generation framework is developed for crowdsourced trajectories evaluation and selection. In addition, three different multi-source integration models are applied to fuse the information of PINS, Wi-Fi FTM and RSSI fingerprinting, and calibrate the Wi-Fi ranging bias in real time, which is further enhanced by a novel misclosure check and the multi-layer perceptron contained signal quality evaluation strategy. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed H-WPS achieves much more precise and universal indoor positioning performance compared with the single location source, and meter-level localization precision can be realized in the Wi-Fi FTM covered indoor scenes.

implementation of indoor positioning methods: virtual hospital case,2021.0,1.0,"Indoor positioning systems (IPS) have great potential to define the location of objects with no GPS or other radionavigation data. Such systems include location estimation algorithms based on time series data from Wi-Fi, BLE, and other devices. Algorithms use to tracking location in real-time and obtain a trajectory close to the actual path. This, in turn, opens up opportunities for finding typical pathways, queues, and bottlenecks in various indoor places. IPS are often used in healthcare, and they are an essential part of the organization of internal processes in the case of a virtual hospital. In this research, we use iBeacons equipment because of its low cost and ease of use. However, the signals received at the objects have high noise, and the location estimation algorithms have an error that accumulates over time. This paper considered two ways to solve high noise: a probabilistic-based method and a neural network method. These algorithms have closer errors (2.11 - 0.96 m), but using the neural network method makes it possible to increase the performance of the indoor positioning algorithms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

detectdui: an in-car detection system for drink driving and bacs,2021.0,0.0,"As one of the biggest contributors to road accidents and fatalities, drink driving is worthy of significant research attention. However, most existing systems on detecting or preventing drink driving either require special hardware or require much effort from the user, making these systems inapplicable to continuous drink driving monitoring in a real driving environment. In this paper, we present DetectDUI, a contactless, non-invasive, real-time system that yields a relatively highly accurate drink driving monitoring by combining vital signs (heart rate and respiration rate) extracted from in-car WiFi system and driver's psychomotor coordination through steering wheel operations. The framework consists of a series of signal processing algorithms for extracting clean and informative vital signs and psychomotor coordination, and integrate the two data streams using a self-attention convolutional neural network (i.e., C-Attention). In safe laboratory experiments with 15 participants, DetectDUI achieves drink driving detection accuracy of 96.6&#x0025; and BAC predictions with an average mean error of 2 ~ 5mg/dl.

security framework for smart cyber infrastructure,2021.0,0.0,"The rapid deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices have led to the development of innovative information services, unavailable a few years ago. To provide these services, IoT devices connect and communicate using networks like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet. This full-stack connection of the IoT devices has introduced a grand security challenge. This paper presents an IoT security framework to protect smart infrastructures from cyber attacks. This IoT security framework is applied to Bluetooth protocol and IoT sensors networks. For the Bluetooth protocol, the intrusion detection system (IDS) uses n-grams to extract temporal and spatial features of Bluetooth communication. The Bluetooth IDS has a precision of 99.6% and a recall of 99.6% using classification technique like Ripper algorithm and Decision Tree (C4.5). We also used AdaBoost, support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Bagging algorithm for intrusion detection. The Sensor IDS uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to extract spatial and temporal features characteristics of the observed signal. Using the detailed coefficients of Biorthogonal DWT, Daubechies DWT, Coiflets DWT, Discrete Meyer DWT, Reverse Biorthogonal DWT, Symlets DWT, we present the results for detecting attacks with One-Class SVM, Local Outlier Factor, and Elliptic Envelope. The attacks used in our evaluation include Denial of Service Attacks, Impersonation Attacks, Random Signal Attacks, and Replay Attacks on temperature sensors.

a novel method for quantitative analysis of c-reactive protein lateral flow immunoassays images via cmos sensor and recurrent neural networks,2021.0,0.0,"Objective: To design and implement an easy-to-use, Point-of-Care (PoC) lateral flow immunoassays (LFA) reader and data analysis system, which provides a more in-depth quantitative analysis for LFA images than conventional approaches thereby supporting efficient decision making for potential early risk assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods and procedures: A novel end-to-end system was developed including a portable device with CMOS camera integrated with optimized illumination and optics to capture the LFA images produced using high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) (concentration level < 5 mg/L). The images were transmitted via WiFi to a back-end server system for image analysis and classification. Unlike common image classification approaches which are based on averaging image intensity from a region-of-interest (ROI), a novel approach was developed which considered the signal along the sample's flow direction as a time series and, consequently, no need for ROI detection. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were deployed for multilevel classification. The features based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and histogram bin counts (HBC) were explored for classification. Results: For the classification of hsCRP, the LSTM outperformed the traditional machine learning classifiers with or without DTW and HBC features performed the best (with mean accuracy of 94%) compared to other features. Application of the proposed method to human plasma also suggests that HBC features from LFA time series performed better than the mean from ROI and raw LFA data. Conclusion: As a proof of concept, the results demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework for quantitative analysis of LFA images and suggest the potential for early risk assessment of CVD. Clinical impact: The hsCRP levels < 5 mg/L were aligned with clinically actionable categories for early risk assessment of CVD. The outcomes demonstrated the real-world applicability of the proposed system for quantitative analysis of LFA images, which is potentially useful for more LFA applications beyond presented in this study. © 2013 IEEE.",CMOS image sensor; dynamic time warping; high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein; Lateral flow immunoassays (LFA); long short-term memory (LSTM),"Jing M., McLaughlin D., McNamee S.E., Raj S., Namee B.M., Steele D., Finlay D., McLaughlin J.",Article,novel quantitative c reactive protein lateral flow immunoassay image cmos sensor recurrent neural objective design implement easy use point care poc lateral flow immunoassay lfa reader provide depth quantitative lfa image conventional approach support efficient decision make potential early risk assessment cardiovascular disease cvd method procedure novel end end develop include portable device cmos camera integrate optimize illumination optic capture lfa image produce high sensitivity c reactive protein hscrp concentration level < mg l image transmit end server image classification unlike common image classification approach base average image intensity region roi novel approach develop consider signal sample flow direction time series consequently need roi detection long short term memory lstm deploy multilevel classification feature base dynamic time warp dtw histogram bin count hbc explore classification result classification hscrp lstm outperform traditional machine classifier dtw hbc feature perform good mean accuracy compare feature application propose human plasma suggest hbc feature lfa time series perform well mean roi raw lfa conclusion proof concept result demonstrate capability propose framework quantitative lfa image suggest potential early risk assessment cvd clinical impact hscrp level < mg l align clinically actionable category early risk assessment cvd outcome demonstrate real world applicability propose quantitative lfa image potentially useful lfa application present cmos image sensor dynamic time warping high sensitivity c reactive protein lateral flow immunoassay lfa long short term memory lstm
exploiting serialized fine-grained action recognition using wifi sensing,2021.0,0.0,"Gestures serve an important role in enabling natural interactions with computing devices, and they form an important part of everyday nonverbal communication. In increasingly many application scenarios of gesture interaction, such as gesture-based authentication, calligraphy, sketching, and even artistic expression, not only are the underlying gestures complex and consist of multiple strokes but also the correctness of the gestures depends on the order at which the strokes are performed. In this paper, we present WiCG, an innovative and novel WiFi sensing approach for capturing and providing feedback on stroke order. Our approach tracks the user's hand movement during writing and exploits this information in combination with statistical methods and machine learning techniques to infer what characters have been written and at which stroke order. We consider Chinese calligraphy as our use case as the resulting gestures are highly complex, and their assessment depends on the correct stroke order. We develop a set of analyses and algorithms to overcome many issues of this challenging task. We have conducted extensive experiments and user studies to evaluate our approach. Experimental results show that our approach is highly effective in identifying the written characters and their written stroke order.

The present deep learning (DL) literature focused on studying HAs from one subject, with several schemes differing in the recognition method, and sensing strategy. However, few research interests have been dedicated to situations where numerous individuals interact to perform common activities. This challenge is termed human-to-human interaction (H2HI) recognition. This study addresses the H2HI problem by a novel device-free DL model, named H2HI-NET, for modeling the HA representation of the Channel State Information of Wireless Fidelity devices. In H2HI-NET, a bi-directional temporal learning module is introduced to capture temporal representation from historical and future information. Simultaneously, the residual spatial learning module is designed to combine residual learning and transformer network capabilities for the efficient extraction of complex spatial features of HAs.

ctsloc: an indoor localization method based on cnn by using time-series rssi,2021.0,0.0,"Due to the complexities of indoor WiFi signal propagations, it is challenging to improve the performance of indoor fingerprint-based positioning techniques which is the main hot research in Internet of Things. Most existing methods have limited positioning accuracy, since they do not take the full advantage of the information available, i.e. timing information attached to the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) vector, and adopt the inappropriate training methods. This paper proposes an indoor localization method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by using time-series RSSI, termed CTSLoc, by taking into account the correlation among RSSI in time and space. A CNN model is used to extract the temporal fluctuation patterns of RSSI and learn the nonlinear mappings from the signal features with time and space to position coordinates. Finally the trained model is used to predict the user’s location. An extensive experiment has been carried out in a space with the size of nearly 1000 squared meters, and a comprehensive comparison with several existing methods indicates that CTSLoc attains a lower average localization error (i.e. 4.23 m) and more stable performance than those methods. The CTSLoc method performs relatively less dependent on the amount of data which also eliminates spatial ambiguity and reduces the effect of noise on localization. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",CNN; IoT; IPS; Time-series RSSI; WiFi indoor localization,"Liu J., Jia B., Guo L., Huang B., Wang L., Baker T.",Article,ctsloc indoor localization base cnn time series rssi complexity indoor signal propagation challenge improve indoor fingerprint base positioning technique main hot internet thing exist method limit positioning accuracy advantage information available i.e. time information attach receive signal strength indicator rssi vector adopt inappropriate training method propose indoor localization base convolutional neural cnn time series rssi term ctsloc take account correlation rssi time space cnn model extract temporal fluctuation pattern rssi nonlinear mapping signal feature time space position coordinate finally train model predict user location extensive experiment carry space size nearly squared meter comprehensive comparison exist method indicate ctsloc attain low average localization error i.e. 4.23 m stable method ctsloc perform relatively dependent eliminate spatial ambiguity reduce effect noise localization author(s exclusive licence springer science+business medium llc springer nature cnn iot ip time series rssi indoor localization

decimeter level indoor localisation with a single wifi router using csi fingerprinting,2021.0,0.0,"The accurate localisation of multiple objects and people in indoor environments is challenging. The problem is of immense importance in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In many scenarios, there is a high density of people and objects which need to be spatially and temporally tracked. As IoT applications find increasing use not only in industrial applications but also in novel areas such as healthcare in the hospital settings, indoor localisation challenges need redress. The paper addresses a novel technique for indoor localisation for a resolution of 10 cm for Line-of-sight (LoS), and Non-Line-of-sight (NLoS) setup. The received signal strength indication (RSSI) based on WiFi signal is thoroughly studied in the past and has offered localisation solutions, yet it is highly sensitive to temporal and spatial variance due to multipath effect. The Channel state information (CSI) signal transmitted from WiFi hardware offers both space and time information, remains relatively stable with multipath propagation and interference, thereby the signal is considered highly suitable for designing localisation techniques with precision. The proposed solution is designed on an open source hardware, and CSI fingerprinting database for 100 locations that are spaced 10 cm apart for line-of-sight (LOS) and Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) configurations are acquired to generate classifier models using different Machine Learning algorithms. Random forest classifier model showed localisation results of 93.15% and 98.01% for LOS and NLOS respectively, for a resolution of 10 cm, which is reported for the first time.

a channel adaptive wifi indoor localization method based on deep learning,2021.0,0.0,"With the increasing demand on Indoor Location-Based Services (ILBS), various positioning technologies had emerged in the past decades, and WiFi-based approach is one of the most promising ones. However, the existing WiFi localization methods fail to take into account the disparate influence of packets transmitted in different channels so as to inhibit the further improvement of localization accuracy. Therefore, we present CADNN: a Channel Adaptive WiFi localization method based on Deep Neural Network (DNN). Specifically, a comprehensive analysis on signal attenuations in different channels along with error analysis based on Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is conducted in theory. Then, the channel set splitting scheme for practical localization to leverage multi-channel features is proposed. Finally, we design a localization framework using multi-objective regression DNN to adapt Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements from different channel sets.

on the robustness of intrusion detection systems for vehicles against adversarial attacks,2021.0,0.0,"Because connected cars typically have several communication capabilities (through 5G, WiFi, and Bluetooth), and third-party applications can be installed on the cars, it would be essential to deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) to prevent attacks from external attackers or malicious applications. Therefore, many IDS proposals have been presented to protect the controller area network (CAN) in a vehicle. Some studies showed that deep neural network models could be effectively used to detect various attacks on the CAN bus. However, it is still questionable whether such an IDS is sufficiently robust against adversarial attacks that are crafted aiming to target the IDS. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm to generate adversarial CAN attack messages for Denial-of-Service (DoS), fuzzy, and spoofing attacks to target the state-of-the-art deep learning-based IDS for CAN. The experimental results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art IDS is not effective in detecting the generated adversarial CAN attack messages.

wihgr: a robust wifi-based human gesture recognition system via sparse recovery and modified attention-based bgru,2021.0,0.0,"Gesture recognition is an essential part in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and Internet of things system. Compared with the existing technologies based on wearable sensors and dedicated devices, approaches using WiFi channel state information (CSI) signals are more desirable for passive and fine-grained gesture recognition. However, the existing CSI-based gesture recognition systems usually suffer from high model complexity and low accuracy caused by environmental dynamics. To address these issues, we propose a robust gesture recognition system (WiHGR) in this paper. The WiHGR starts with a sparse recovery method to find the dominant paths from the multipath effect introduced by orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, i.e., the main propagation paths disturbed by a human gesture. Then, the phase difference matrix is constructed according to the phase differences between two adjacent receiving antennas from the dominant paths. We propose a modified attention based bi-directional gate recurrent unit (ABGRU) network to learn and extract discriminative features automatically from the phase difference matrix. The proposed attention mechanism assigns higher weights to the more important features, thus achieving a better recognition performance. Experimental results show that the WiHGR not only has a high accuracy for gesture recognition in the training environment, but also has a remarkable performance in new environment settings without retraining.

deepdespy: a deep learning-based wireless spy camera detection system,2021.0,0.0,"Spy cameras planted in various private places, such as motels, hotels, homestays (i.e., Airbnb), and restrooms, have raised immense privacy concerns. Wi-Fi spy cameras are used extensively by various adversaries because of easy installability, followed by size reduction. To prevent invasions of privacy, most studies have detected wireless cameras based on video traffic analysis and require additional synchronous data from external sensors or stimulus hardware to confirm the user's motion. Such supplements make the users uncomfortable, requiring extra effort and time for setting. This paper proposes an effective spy camera detection system called DeepDeSpy to detect the recording of a spy camera with no effort from the user. The core idea is using the channel state information (CSI) and the network traffic from the camera to detect whether the wireless camera records the movements of the user. The CSI signal is prone to motion, and detecting motion from an enormous amount of CSI data in real-time is challenging. This was handled by leveraging the convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) deep learning methods. Such synergistic CNN and BiLSTM deep learning models enable instant and accurate detection by automatically extracting meaningful features from the sequential raw CSI data. The feasibility of DeepDeSpy was verified by implementing it on both a PC and a smartphone and evaluating it in real-life scenarios (e.g., various room sizes and user physical activities).

iot and biosensors: a smart portable potentiostat with advanced cloud-enabled features,2021.0,0.0,"Recent advances in Internet-of-Things technology have opened the doors to new scenarios for biosensor applications. Flexibility, portability, and remote control and access are of utmost importance to move these devices to people's homes or in a Point-of-Care context and rapidly share the results with users and their physicians. In this paper, an innovative portable device for both quantitative and semi-quantitative electrochemical analysis is presented. This device can operate autonomously without the need of relying on other devices (e.g., PC, tablets, or smartphones) thanks to built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. The developed hardware is integrated into a cloud-based platform, exploiting the cloud computational power to perform innovative algorithms for calibration (e.g., Machine Learning tools).

towards optimizing wlans power saving: context-aware listen interval,2021.0,0.0,"Despite the rapid growth of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), the energy consumption caused by wireless communication remains a significant factor in reducing the battery life of power-constrained wireless devices. To reduce the energy consumption, static and adaptive power saving mechanisms have been deployed in WLANs. However, some inherent drawbacks and limitations remain. We have developed the concept of Context-Aware Listen Interval (CALI), in which the wireless network interface, with the aid of a Machine Learning (ML) classification model, sleeps and awakes based on the level of network activity of each application. In this paper we develop the power saving modes of CALI. The experimental results show that CALI consumes up to 75% less power when compared to the currently deployed power saving mechanism on the latest generation of smartphones, and up to 14% less energy when compared to Pyles' et al.

recognition of uav video signal using rf fingerprints in the presence of wifi interference,2021.0,1.0,"This paper investigates the problem of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recognition in the presence of WiFi interference using passive radio frequency (RF) detection. The proposed method relies on machine learning based RF recognition and considers the scenario in the bandwidth of the video signal (VS) and WiFi are identical. Our machine learning strategy involves extracting 31 features from the WiFi signal and the UAV VS, which are then input to the classifier. Among the 31 features, 30 are statistical in the time and frequency domain, while the remaining one involves the effective subcarrier feature. We evaluate four different machine learning (ML) classifier variants and demonstrate through simulation and experiments that the proposed method can accurately recognize UAV VS in the presence of WiFi interference. We also improve the feature-vector compactness and reduce the 31-feature vector to a 6-feature vector composed of the most significant features and demonstrate that the recognition performance of random forest method (RandF) classifier is not compromised. The most appealing performance for the 6-feature vector case is attained by the RandF, managing a recognition rate of 100% in the indoor experiment and 96.26% in the 2 km outdoor experiment.

hotel2vec: learning hotel embeddings from user click sessions with side information,2021.0,0.0,"We propose a new neural network architecture for learning vector representations of items with attributes, specifically hotels. Unlike previous works, which typically only rely on modeling of user-item interactions for learning item embeddings, we propose a framework that combines several sources of data, including user clicks, hotel attributes (e.g., property type, star rating, average user rating), amenity information (e.g., if the hotel has free Wi-Fi or free breakfast), and geographic information that leverages an hexagonal geospatial system as well as spatial encoders. During model training, a joint embedding is learned from all of the above information. We show that including structured attributes about hotels enables us to make better predictions in a downstream task than when we rely exclusively on click data. We train our embedding model on more than 60 million user click sessions from a leading online travel platform, and learn embeddings for more than one million hotels. Our final learned embeddings integrate distinct sub-embeddings for user clicks, hotel attributes, and geographic information, providing a representation that can be used flexibly depending on the application. An important advantage of the proposed neural model is that it addresses the cold-start problem for hotels with insufficient historical click information by incorporating additional hotel attributes, which are available for all hotels. We show through the results of an online A/B test that our model generates high-quality representations that boost the performance of a hotel recommendation system on a large online travel platform.

wisual: indoor crowd density estimation and distribution visualization using wi-fi,2021.0,0.0,"Driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), many device-free crowd density estimation techniques can roughly estimate the crowd density based on the relationship between the dynamic crowd and the variation of wireless signals. However, they cannot distinguish the path information of different persons in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose Wisual, a Channel State Information (CSI) based device-free crowd density estimation framework and can visualize the distribution of people. The major challenge of Wisual is how to extract proper quantifiable indexes to distinguish the path information of multiple targets and maximize the resolution of crowd density estimation. To address this challenge, Wisual first presents a method for estimating the frequency of the CSI propagation path (FoC) for the moving persons and constructs a joint multi-feature parameter (JMFP) spectrum matrix with the other two parameters. Then the multi-target spectrum matrix is put into a proposed deep-learning model called CSI stream 3D convolutional neural networks (CS-3DCNN) for implementing crowd density estimation and the target path information differentiation. Finally, Wi-Fi imaging is implemented based on the 2D-MUSIC algorithm, which shows the approximate distribution situation of indoor persons through the spectrograms. The experimental results in typical real-world scenes demonstrate that Wisual can forecast the crowd density with 98% precision and accurately display the frequency spectra of moving persons. Besides, the results also prove the superior effectiveness, scalability, and generalizability of the proposed framework.

real-time nlos/los identification for smartphone-based indoor positioning systems using wifi rtt and rss,2021.0,0.0,"The accuracy of smartphone-based positioning systems using WiFi usually suffers from ranging errors caused by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. Previous research usually exploits several distribution features from a long time series (hundreds of samples) of WiFi received signal strength (RSS) or WiFi round-trip time (RTT) to achieve a high identification accuracy. However, the long time series or large sample size attributes to high power and time consumption in data collection for both training and testing. This will also undoubtedly be detrimental to user experience as the waiting time for getting enough samples is quite long. Therefore, this paper proposes three new real-time NLOS/LOS identification methods for smartphone-based indoor positioning systems using WiFi RSS and RTT distance measurement (RDM). Based on our extensive analysis of RSS and RDM dispersion features, three machine learning algorithms were chosen and developed to separate the samples for NLOS/LOS conditions. Experiments show that our best method achieves a discrimination accuracy of over 96% with a sample size of 10. Considering the theoretically shortest WiFi ranging interval of 100ms of the RTT-enabled smartphones, our algorithm is able to provide the shortest latency of 1s to get the testing result among all of the state-of-art methods.

indoor positioning using deep-learning-based pedestrian dead reckoning and optical camera communication,2021.0,1.0,"The need for an accurate indoor positioning system has rapidly increased with the development of large complex malls and underground spaces. As signals from the global positioning system cannot be received inside buildings, only approximate locations can be estimated using Wi-Fi routers or cellular base station information, and exact locations cannot be determined. Therefore, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) scheme using several sensors is suggested in this work. However, this scheme requires users to hold their smartphones in a specific manner; furthermore, user-dependent parameters, such as height and step length, are necessary because the sensor parameters vary. This study uses deep-learning algorithms to overcome the limitations of the existing smartphone-based PDR scheme. A convolutional neural network algorithm is used to classify the smartphone positions; then, appropriate sensor data are selected and adjusted. The long short-term memory algorithm is used to estimate the user step length. Although the PDR performance is enhanced using the deep-learning algorithm, accumulated error is unavoidable because the algorithm traces the relative position with reference to the original location. Therefore, optical camera communication is introduced to provide the reference location and periodically compensate for the accumulated PDR error. The proposed algorithm is experimentally demonstrated, and its results are obtained and analyzed. © 2013 IEEE.",Deep learning; Indoor positioning; Optical camera communication; Pedestrian dead reckoning,"Jeong S., Min J., Park Y.",Article,indoor positioning deep base pedestrian dead reckoning optical camera communication need accurate indoor positioning rapidly increase development large complex mall underground space signal global positioning receive inside building approximate location estimate router cellular station information exact location determine pedestrian dead reckoning pdr scheme sensor suggest work scheme require user hold smartphone specific manner furthermore user dependent parameter height step length necessary sensor parameter vary use deep algorithm overcome limitation exist smartphone base pdr scheme convolutional neural algorithm classify smartphone position appropriate sensor select adjust long short term memory algorithm estimate user step length pdr enhance deep algorithm accumulate error unavoidable algorithm trace relative position reference original location optical camera communication introduce provide reference location periodically compensate accumulate pdr error propose algorithm experimentally demonstrate result obtain analyze deep indoor positioning optical camera communication pedestrian dead reckoning
measurement and prediction of indoor wideband electric field radiation,2021.0,0.0,"Indoor wideband electromagnetic radiation (EMR) over seven days and potential radiation sources were measured and analyzed in this article. The research results show that Wi-Fi and base station equipment are the main factors causing indoor electromagnetic exposure, and the radiation intensity of the former is much higher than the latter when the equipment is working. Also, the change of EMR over time conforms to the users' daily work and rest cycle and contains a significant low-frequency component with a 24-h cycle and complex high-frequency components. Besides, the intensive use of electronic products by users has been proven to have a great impact on the frequency characteristics of the electric field, and the complexity of the time-frequency characteristics of EMR time series has increased, resulting in poor prediction results of the models such as the seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA) model and the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. To this end, a prediction scheme combining wavelet transform and time-series analysis methods is proposed in this article. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method, the samples of three days are exploited to perform a loop test of the prediction accuracy under different prediction steps. Besides, the results are compared with those obtained by single SARIMA and LSTM. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid prediction method effectively predicts electric field radiation with complex frequency characteristics and significantly outperforms other methods in terms of prediction accuracy and prediction length. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Electromagnetic radiation (EMR); hybrid method; measurement; seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA); time series analysis; wavelet transform,"Li R., Yue Y., Song X., Ji S.",Article,measurement prediction indoor wideband electric field radiation indoor wideband electromagnetic radiation emr seven day potential radiation source measure analyze article result station equipment main factor cause indoor electromagnetic exposure radiation intensity high equipment work change emr time conform user daily work rest cycle contain significant low frequency component h cycle complex high frequency component intensive use electronic product user prove great impact frequency characteristic electric field complexity time frequency characteristic emr time series increase result poor prediction result model seasonal autoregressive move average sarima model long short term memory lstm neural end prediction scheme combine wavelet transform time series method propose article verify effectiveness propose hybrid sample day exploit perform loop test prediction accuracy different prediction step result compare obtain single sarima lstm experimental result propose hybrid prediction effectively predict electric field radiation complex frequency characteristic significantly outperform method term prediction accuracy prediction length electromagnetic radiation emr hybrid measurement seasonal autoregressive move average sarima time series wavelet transform

This network is a decentralised network. And it does not have Wi-Fi access point or Router. But, the main drawback of Ad hoc mode is minimal security.

So that, these intrusion detection systems can monitor the network operation and detect the attack. In current digital information world, with the help of machine learning algorithms the intrusion detection systems were built. These IDS perform well and tries to attain better accuracy and speed.

small csi samples-based activity recognition: a deep learning approach using multidimensional features,2021.0,0.0,"With the emergence of tools for extracting CSI data from commercial WiFi devices, CSI-based device-free activity recognition technology has developed rapidly and has been widely used in security monitoring, smart home, medical monitoring, and other fields. However, the existing CSI-based activity recognition algorithms need a large number of training samples to obtain the ideal recognition accuracy. To solve the problem, an attention-based bidirectional LSTM method using multidimensional features (called MF-ABLSTM method) is proposed. In this method, the signal preprocessing and continuous wavelet transform algorithms are used to construct time-frequency matrix, the sample entropy is used to characterize the statistical feature of CSI amplitudes, the energy difference at a fixed time interval is used to characterize the time-domain feature of activities, and the energy distribution of different frequency components is used to characterize the frequency-domain feature of activities. By expanding the training samples with the proposed tensor prediction algorithm, the accurate activity recognition can be realized with only a few samples.

wifi-based cross-domain gesture recognition via modified prototypical networks,2021.0,0.0,"Numerous deep learning studies have achieved remarkable advances in WiFi-based human gesture recognition (HGR) using channel state information (CSI). However, since the CSI patterns of the same gesture change across domains (i.e., users, environments, locations, and orientations), recognition accuracy might degrade significantly when applying the trained model to new domains. To overcome this problem, we propose a WiFi-based cross-domain gesture recognition system (WiGr) which has a domain-transferable mapping to construct an embedding space where the representations of samples from the same class are clustered, and those from different classes are separated. The key insight of WiGr is using the similarity between the query sample representation and the class prototypes in the embedding space to perform the gesture classification, which can avoid the influence of the cross-domain CSI patterns change. Meanwhile, we present a Dual-Path prototypical network (Dual-Path PN) which consists of a deep feature extractor and a dual-path (i.e., Path-A and Path-B substructures) recognizer. The trained feature extractor can extract the gesture-related domain-independent features from CSI, namely the domain-transferable mapping. In addition, WiGr implements the cross-domain HGR based on only a pair of WiFi devices without retraining in the new domain.

contention window optimization in ieee 802.11ax networks with deep reinforcement learning,2021.0,1.0,"The proper setting of contention window (CW) values has a significant impact on the efficiency of Wi-Fi networks. Unfortunately, the standard method used by 802.11 networks is not scalable enough to maintain stable throughput for an increasing number of stations, yet it remains the default method of channel access for 802.11ax single-user transmissions. Therefore, we propose a new method of CW control, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) principles to learn the correct settings under different network conditions. Our method, called centralized contention window optimization with DRL (CCOD), supports two trainable control algorithms: deep Q-network (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG).

multi-armed bandits for spectrum allocation in multi-agent channel bonding wlans,2021.0,0.0,"While dynamic channel bonding (DCB) is proven to boost the capacity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) by adapting the bandwidth on a per-frame basis, its performance is tied to the primary and secondary channel selection. Unfortunately, in uncoordinated high-density deployments where multiple basic service sets (BSSs) may potentially overlap, hand-crafted spectrum management techniques perform poorly given the complex hidden/exposed nodes interactions. To cope with such challenging Wi-Fi environments, in this paper, we first identify machine learning (ML) approaches applicable to the problem at hand and justify why model-free RL suits it the most. We then design a complete RL framework and call into question whether the use of complex RL algorithms helps the quest for rapid learning in realistic scenarios. Through extensive simulations, we derive that stateless RL in the form of lightweight multi-armed-bandits (MABs) is an efficient solution for rapid adaptation avoiding the definition of broad and/or meaningless states. In contrast to most current trends, we envision lightweight MABs as an appropriate alternative to the cumbersome and slowly convergent methods such as Q-learning, and especially, deep reinforcement learning. © 2013 IEEE.",Channel bonding; multi-agent; multi-armed bandit; reinforcement learning; spectrum allocation,"Barrachina-Munoz S., Chiumento A., Bellalta B.",Article,multi armed bandit spectrum allocation multi agent channel bonding wlan dynamic channel bonding dcb prove boost capacity local area wlan adapt bandwidth frame basis tie primary secondary channel selection unfortunately uncoordinate high density deployment multiple basic service set bsss potentially overlap hand craft spectrum management technique perform poorly give complex hide expose node interaction cope challenging environment identify machine ml approach applicable problem hand justify model free rl suit design complete rl framework question use complex rl algorithm help quest rapid realistic scenario extensive simulation derive stateless rl form lightweight multi armed bandit mab efficient solution rapid adaptation avoid definition broad and/or meaningless state contrast current trend envision lightweight mab appropriate alternative cumbersome slowly convergent method q especially deep reinforcement channel bonding multi agent multi armed bandit reinforcement spectrum allocation
urban human mobility modelling and prediction: impact of comfort and well-being indicators,2021.0,0.0,"There are increasingly more discussions on and guidelines about different levels of indicators surrounding smart cities (e.g., comfort, well-being and weather conditions). They are an important opportunity to illustrate how smart urban development strategies and digital tools can be stretched or reinvented to address localised social issues. Thus, multi-source heterogeneous data provides a new driving force for exploring urban human mobility patterns. In this work, we forecast human mobility using indoor or outdoor environment datasets, respectively, Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Wi-Fi and LinkNYC kiosks, collected in New York City to study how comfort and well-being indicators influence people’s movements. By comparing the forecasting performance of statistical and Deep Learning (DL) methods on the aggregated mobile data we show that each class of methods has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the forecasting scenario. However, for our time-series forecasting problem, DL methods are preferable when it comes to simplicity and immediacy of use, since they do not require a time-consuming model selection for each different cell. DL approaches are also appropriate when aiming to reduce the maximum forecasting error. Statistical methods instead have shown their superiority in providing more precise forecasting results, but they require data domain knowledge and computationally expensive techniques in order to select the best parameters. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Deep learning methods; Device network datasets; Human mobility patterns; Statistical methods,"Rosa L., Silva F., Analide C.",Conference Paper,urban human mobility modelling   prediction impact comfort   indicator increasingly discussion guideline different level indicator surround smart city e.g. comfort weather condition important opportunity illustrate smart urban development strategy digital tool stretch reinvent address localise social issue multi source heterogeneous provide new drive force explore urban human mobility pattern work forecast human mobility indoor outdoor environment dataset respectively metropolitan transportation authority mta linknyc kiosks collect new york city comfort indicator influence people movement compare forecasting statistical deep dl method aggregated mobile class method advantage disadvantage depend forecasting scenario time series forecasting problem dl method preferable come simplicity immediacy use require time consume model selection different cell dl approach appropriate aim reduce maximum forecasting error statistical method instead show superiority provide precise forecasting result require domain knowledge computationally expensive technique order select good parameter springer nature switzerland ag deep method device dataset human mobility pattern statistical method
low-cost wi-fi fingerprinting indoor localization via generative deep learning,2021.0,0.0,"Wi-Fi fingerprinting indoor localization has been studied in past decades producing many outstanding work. However, few has been deployed in real-world scenarios. One of the pain points is time-consuming and effort-intensive fingerprint mapping. In this paper, we leverage a large number of low-cost fingerprints without location tags (unlabeled fingerprints) and only a small number of high-cost fingerprints with location tags (labeled fingerprints) to construct a low-cost yet high-accuracy virtual fingerprint map. Specifically, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep generative model, SCVAE (Semi-supervised Conditional Variational AutoEncoder). It generates virtual fingerprints at any given location by learning the underlying probability distribution of Wi-Fi RSS through collected fingerprints, especially the unlabeled ones. A regressor is adopted providing pseudo labels for unlabeled fingerprints. Two efficient training strategies are further designed to improve its performance. Moreover, based on SCVAE, we design and implement a Wi-Fi fingerprinting indoor localization system, DeepPrint (Deep learning of fingerPrinting). It is evaluated extensively in real indoor environments with a total area about 8,400 m 2.

a new set of wi-fi dynamic line-based localization algorithms for indoor environments,2021.0,0.0,"Localization is of great importance in several fields such as healthcare and security. To achieve localization, GPS technologies are common for outdoor localization but are insufficient for indoor localization. This is because the accuracy and precision of the users' indoor locations are influenced by many factors (e.g., multi-path signal propagations and signal fading). As a result, the methodologies and technologies for indoor localization services need continuous refinement. Another challenge is the time complexity of the methodologies which impacts the performance of mobile phones' limited resources. To address these challenges, a new set of fingerprinting algorithms called Fingerprinting Line-Based Nearest Neighbour is designed and implemented. The new set shifts some points such grid points possibly towards target nodes based on a deterministic range of percentages. Furthermore, the new algorithms run in 0(j*d) (i.e., the term y refers to the number of grid points and the term d refers to the number of Received Signal Strength Indicators collected at the online stage). This paper presents the following: 1) the accuracy of the new set of algorithms has a theoretical upper bound in terms of the distance errors, 2) the new set of algorithms (e.g., 90% shifting percentage) improves the accuracy compared to those for several existing Nearest Neighbour (NN)-based algorithms such as the Dual-Scanned Fingerprint Localization and the Soft-Range-Limited KNN (SRL-KNN) by 106% and 68%, respectively, 3) the algorithm improves the precision compared to those for the NN-based algorithms such as the Path-Loss-Based Fingerprint Localization and the SRL-KNN 76% and 73%, respectively, and 4) the new set has lower probabilities related to the position errors compared to those for the existing NN-based algorithms.

unsupervised view-selective deep learning for practical indoor localization using csi,2021.0,0.0,"Due to its high-dimensional data characteristics, the channel state information (CSI) of Wi-Fi signals has become a strong candidate for use in indoor localization. In addition, machine learning techniques can improve the accuracy of indoor localization systems using multiview CSI data received at multiple access points (APs). However, in complex environments, most CSI views collected at APs in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) configurations relative to a transmitter may lose so much useful data information as to become nonsalient. In this paper, we propose a practical machine learning approach named unsupervised view-selective deep learning (UVSDL), in which only the most salient CSI view is selected in an unsupervised manner to be applied in regression for localization. In an experiment in a complex building, our variational deep learning (VDL)-based regression method with the most salient CSI view achieves a localization accuracy of 1.36 m, significantly outperforming the best-known system BiLoc by 25 %.

effective feature selection for hybrid wireless iot network intrusion detection systems using machine learning techniques,2021.0,2.0,"Through the ascent of online business and the Internet of Things (IoT), safety of such frameworks over wireless systems are getting even more an alarm. Hence, the job of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is critical to direct and help the movement of actions over the wireless systems. One of the essential difficulties to IDS is the issue of confusion, misidentification and absence of continuous reaction to the assault. Thus, a hybrid IDS structure that relies upon machine learning classification and clustering procedures is anticipated to decrease the false positive rate, false negative rate, to increase the discovery rate and identify zero-day assaults. Primarily, the features are chosen utilizing feature selection techniques like Information Gain (IG), Chi-Squared statistics (CH), and Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), with the goal that the count of features taking part in the discovery of assaults must be given more importance. Therefore, in the assault discovery stage, first anomaly or profile-based identification model is fabricated utilizing K-means clustering algorithm and based upon the output of profile-based identification, misuse or signature-based identification model is implemented utilizing Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm. Aimed at training and testing of proposed hybrid IDS model Aegean Wi-Fi Dataset (AWID) with three classes of wireless assaults, for example, Impersonation, Injection and Flooding is utilized.

spoofing attack detection using machine learning in cross-technology communication,2021.0,0.0,"Cross-technology communication (CTC) technique can realize direct communication among heterogeneous wireless devices (e.g., WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth in the 2.4 G ISM band) without gateway equipment for forwarding, which makes heterogeneous wireless communication more convenient and greatly reduces communication costs. However, compared with the traditional homogeneous network model, CTC technique also makes it easier to implement spoofing attacks in heterogeneous networks. WiFi devices with long communication distances and sufficient energy supply can directly launch spoofing attacks against ZigBee devices, which brings severe security concerns for heterogeneous wireless communications. In this paper, we focus on the CTC spoofing attack, especially spoofing attacks from WiFi to ZigBee and propose a machine learning-based method to detect spoofing attacks for heterogeneous wireless networks by using physical-layer information. First, we model the received signal strength (RSS) data of legitimate ZigBee devices to construct a one-class support vector machine (OSVM) classifier for detecting CTC spoofing attacks depending on the obtained training samples. Then, we simulated CTC spoofing attacks in a live testbed and evaluated the performance of our detection method. Results show that our approach is highly effective in spoofing detection. Even if the distance between the legitimate ZigBee device and WiFi attacker is near each other (i.e., less than 2 m) and does not require a large number of samples, the detection rate and precision of our method are both over 90%.

real-time non-intrusive electrical load classification over iot using machine learning,2021.0,0.0,"In this era of technological advancement, the flow of an enormous amount of information has become such an inevitable phenomenon that makes a path for the takeover of the internet of things (IoT) based smart grid from the currently available grid system. In a smart grid, demand-side management plays a crucial role in reducing the generation capacity by shifting the user energy consumption from peak period to off-peak period, which requires detailed knowledge of the user consumption at the individual appliance level. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) provides an exceptionally low-cost solution for determining individual appliance levels using a single-point measurement. This paper proposed an IoT-based real-time non-intrusive load classification (RT-NILC) system considering the variability of supply voltage using low-frequency data. Due to the unavailability of smart meters at the household level in Bangladesh, a data-acquisition system (DAS) is developed. The DAS is capable of measuring and storing rms voltage, rms current, active power, and power factor data at a sampling rate of 1 Hz. These data are processed to train different multilabel classification models. The best-performed classification model has been selected and utilized for the implementation of RT-NILC over IoT. The Firebase real-time online database is considered for data storage to flow the data in two-way between end-user and service provider (energy distributor). The GPRS module is used for wireless data transmission as a Wi-Fi network may not be available everywhere. Windows and web applications are developed for data visualization. The proposed system has been validated in real-time, using rms voltage, rms current, and active power measurements at a real house. Even under supply voltage variability, the performance evaluation of the RT-NILC system has shown an average classification accuracy of more than 94%.

dhcloc: a device heterogeneity tolerant and channel adaptive passive wifi localization method based on dnn,2021.0,1.0,"Passive WiFi localization refers to determining the location of WiFi enabled mobile devices by deploying dedicated WiFi access points to sniff WiFi packets transmitted by these mobile devices and measure the corresponding Received Signal Strengths (RSSs) for use in localization. However, most existing studies fail to consider the effect of multiple channels where WiFi packets are transmitted and sniffed. The problem is further exacerbated by device heterogeneity occurring cross various mobile devices. In this paper, we present a unified Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based solution, termed DHCLoc, to address these two challenges. To be specific, a Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB)-based analysis reveals that utilizing multi-channel information will benefit localization, motivating us to include channel information into DHCLoc. Moreover, a novel Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)-based localization framework is introduced by incorporating a new variable to characterize the RSS measurement offsets caused by device heterogeneity, inspiring us to apply adversarial training to adopt such offsets against device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using two real-world datasets are conducted, and show that, in comparison with several existing methods, DHCLoc can improve the localization accuracy by at least 25.2% and 25.8% respectively.

robustifying wi-fi localization by between-location data augmentation,2021.0,0.0,"Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor localization is one of the most practical localization methods, which does not require extra infrastructure and special hardware. However, we need to acquire a dataset with a high-density dataset in the target environment in this framework. To overcome the data acquisition cost problem, we propose a brand new data augmentation for Wi-Fi indoor localization named Between-Location data augmentation (BL data augmentation). We generate the fingerprint data for the whole target environment with high density by only using the sparsely sampled data. Between-Class learning, which is the origin of BL data augmentation and the latest powerful data augmentation method for sound recognition and image processing, mixes two data linearly with normalization; however, this mixing does not make sense in indoor localization because mixed fingerprint has no meaning and the label of indoor localization is not categorical information but physically correlated information. To overcome these two problems, we propose the generative model based on neural networks installed the physical relationship of labels and Wi-Fi fingerprint property. BL data augmentation enables us to reduce data sampled locations while keeping the localization accuracy even if some target locations have no data. From the experimental results, indoor localization methods with BL data augmentation outperform the state-of-the-art data augmentation method on several indoor localization models, whatever the data collection location is dense or sparse.

a robust statistical cnnctc-based ai model for tracking and monitoring covid-19,2021.0,0.0,"The world today battles the new coronavirus (COVID-19) spread that can lead to a major endemic or pandemic outbreak with devastating outcomes which has overturned all our usual calculus seemingly. Because of the unavailability of a vaccine and the serious extent of infectiousness, social distancing is perhaps the only way left to fight the infection. The tracking system is still a challenge for monitoring the COVID-19 affected person and the community spread. This leads to an epidemic situation, where the number of secondary infections keeps going higher and higher which intern leads to the difficulty of tracking and treating each infected person. An AI-based mathematical modelling is proposed for tracking and monitoring the pandemic outbreak. A GPS tracking system, geolocation using Fit bit and Wi-Fi tracking modules are developed to locate the secondary infections and the carriers. Calculation of real-time coordinates and the conditional probabilities with respect to time is done followed by the classification based on risk using CNN connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model, a type of neural network which is used to train the recurrent process. Monitoring the affected person using sensors like thermal sensors and a tracking chip inbuilt in a wristband for real-time updates. A comparative study is done on various classification models.

wireless local area network intrusion detection system using deep belief networks,2021.0,0.0,"In computer security Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a mechanism of detecting an intruder in the system and notifying malicious activities for system administrators. The IDS researches on wireless Local Area Network (LAN) started recently. Until now there are some researches like publishing Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) dataset publically for the research community and evaluating the dataset using different machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose Deep Belief Network (DBN) to evaluate AWID dataset for intrusion detection analysis. Since AWID dataset contains different data types which are numeric, string, and hexadecimals; before training the model and evaluation of its performance the dataset is preprocessed and finally 102 attributes are used for system training. Also, two-stage feature selection is implemented to reduce the training cost and improve system performance. The first stage is removing duplicated attributes which reduced the dataset size to 68 attributes. The second stage is done by applying Weka implemented Information Gain Ratio (IGR). Using three thresholds three datasets are prepared with 41 attributes, 34 attributes, and 25 attributes.

feature-based deep neural networks for short-term prediction of wifi channel occupancy rate,2021.0,1.0,"Spectrum occupancy prediction is a key enabling technology to facilitate a proactive resource allocation for dynamic spectrum management systems. This work focuses on the prediction of duty cycle (DC) metric that reflects spectrum usage (in the time domain). The spectrum usage is typically measured on a shorter time scale than needed for prediction. Hence, data thinning is required and we apply block averaging. However, averaging operation results in flattening the DC data and losing essential features to assist deep neural network (DNN) to predict the spectrum usage. To improve DC prediction after block averaging, a feature-based deep learning framework is proposed. Namely, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are selected and enhanced by using features of the data, such as the variance of DC data in addition to DC data themself. The proposed model is capable of proactively predicting the spectrum usage by capturing complex relationships among various input features for the measured spectrum, thus providing higher prediction accuracy with an average improvement of 5% in RMSE compared with traditional models. Moreover, to have a better understanding of the proposed model, we quantify the effect of input features on the predicted spectrum usage values. Based on the most significant input features, a simpler and more efficient model is proposed to estimate DC with similar accuracy to when using all features. © 2013 IEEE.",5G; deep neural networks; explainable AI; GRU; LSTM; occupancy rate; SHAP; short-term prediction; spectrum awareness; WiFi,"Al-Tahmeesschi A., Umebayashi K., Iwata H., Lehtomäki J., Lopez-Benitez M.",Article,feature base deep neural short term prediction channel occupancy rate spectrum occupancy prediction key enable technology facilitate proactive resource allocation dynamic spectrum management system work focus prediction duty cycle dc metric reflect spectrum usage time domain spectrum usage typically measure short time scale need prediction thinning require apply block averaging average operation result flatten dc lose essential feature assist deep neural dnn predict spectrum usage improve dc prediction block averaging feature base deep framework propose long short term memory lstm gate recurrent unit gru select enhance feature variance dc addition dc themself propose model capable proactively predict spectrum usage capture complex relationship input feature measured spectrum provide high prediction accuracy average improvement rmse compare traditional model well understanding propose model quantify effect input feature predict spectrum usage value base significant input feature simple efficient model propose estimate dc similar accuracy feature g deep neural explainable ai gru lstm occupancy rate shap short term prediction spectrum awareness
multi-modal context propagation for person re-identification with wireless positioning,2021.0,0.0,"Existing person re-identification methods mainly rely on thevisualappearance captured by camerasfor identity matching.However, due to the sensitivity of visual data to occlusion, blur, clothing change, etc.,existing methodsstruggleto distinguish pedestriansin challenging scenarios. Inspired by the fact that most pedestrians carry around smart wireless devices, e.g. mobile phones that can be sensed by WiFi or cellular networks as wireless positioning signals, we propose to exploit the free yet informative wireless signalsto assist person re-identification. It is well recognized thatwireless signals are robust to visual noisesmentioned above, which perform as a good complement to the visual data. To make full use of these multi-modal clues for person re-identification, we propose a multi-modal context propagation framework MCPF that contains a recurrent context propagation module RCPM and an unsupervised multi-modal cross-domain method UMM-ReID. RCPM enables context information to be continuously propagatedand fusedbetween visual data and wireless data. UMM-ReID utilizes wireless signals to constrain the estimation of pseudo labels. To evaluate our approach, we contribute a new wireless positioning person re-identification (WP-ReID) dataset. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

real-time concrete damage detection using deep learning for high rise structures,2021.0,0.0,"Nowadays, the number of aging high-rise civil structures is growing throughout the world, and most of them use concrete as a building material. Concrete may lose its strength due to continuous loading and environmental impacts. As a result, damage (crack and spall) may occur on the exterior surface of the structure. Whenever these deformities are left unexplored and untreated, the integrity of the structure may be compromised. Therefore, regular maintenance of the structure is needed. Some previous vision-based studies have used a drone as a vehicle to capture and record the current state of the structure. Later, captured videos and images were analyzed to determine damage using object classification, localization, and segmentation methods. Also, in a few studies, drones relay the collected data to the server using a wireless medium. However, the developed systems are very complex, time-intensive, and require high bandwidth. To address these problems, this paper uses the edge computing principle to propose a real-time multi-drone damage detection system using one of the advance deep learning models called You Look Only Once-version3 (YOLO-v3) for high-rise civil structures. The proposed system uses Jetson-TX2 as a hardware platform to run YOLO-v3 and is deployed on Pixhawk's hardware standards-based open source hexacopter drone. During a coordinated survey, if the damage is observed, the Jetson-TX2 on-board, after processing, sends only the damage-related information to the server that resides on the ground through the Wi-Fi channel. Our proposed system is evaluated on a dataset containing 800 ( 480 × 480 pixels) images of different types of damage, collected from multiple structures of CSIR-CEERI, Pilani. Manually annotated images are used for the training and testing of the modified YOLO-v3 classifier.

performance comparison of curve fitting and compressed sensing in channel state information feature extraction,2021.0,0.0,"Various commercial Wi-Fi based applications have been proposed, such as indoor positioning, indoor tracking, behavior recognition, gesture recognition, etc. These applications need to use the channel state information (CSI) fed back by Open-Source wireless network card devices, but without prior compression, the CSI feedback overhead is huge, which is not conducive to practical applications. Therefore, in order to promote the application of commercial Wi-Fi, CSI compression plays a key role. In this paper, we compare two compression methods. One is a novel curve fitting method, which can compress CSI by fed back the fitting parameters of CSI curve. The other one is the classical compressed sensing method, which can restore the original signal from a small number of measurements by using the sparsity of the signal specific domain. Using the CSI data collected from commercial Wi-Fi devices, we test the effect of the two compression methods, and compare the effects of the two compression methods on feature extraction with the same CSI feedback overhead.

wi-fi indoor positioning using d-s evidence theory,2021.0,0.0,"The Wi-Fi indoor positioning method is one of research hot-spots in the field of mobile computing. However, the existing methods rarely consider the impact of the diversity of the Received Signal Strength (RSS) on the performance of the signal propagation distance estimation, resulting in the low positioning accuracy and the poor system robustness. In response to this problem, this paper proposes an information fusion-based Wi-Fi indoor positioning method by using the Dempster-Shafer evidence Theory (DST). First of all, the heuristic distribution model is used to establish the mathematical relationship between the RSS data from each Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) and the signal propagation distance. Second, the Gaussian kernel density estimation method is applied to estimate the signal propagation distance distribution. Third, the multi-source RSS information is fused according to DST synthesis rules, and the trust function synthesized by the DST is used to select matching Reference Points (RPs).

a load balancing mechanism for a multi-controller software defined wifi network,2021.0,1.0,"Software defined WiFi networks (SD-WiFi) lead to a promising evolution path, by supporting changes in network traffic, providing centralized network provisioning and allowing flexible resource allocation.

Traffic generated by users constituting the load, arrive at WiFi access points (APs). Support vector machine (SVM) segregates the traffic into high priority class (HP) and low priority class (LP) by considering flow deadlines and flow types. Controllers are arranged in two-tiers: global and local controllers. The local controllers (LC) update their load information to the global controller (GC) periodically. Binary search tree (BST) is employed in the GC to find the least loaded LC for flow processing. OMNeT++ simulator is used to perform extensive simulations for performance evaluation of the proposed SVM-BST scheme.

The increasing number of persons pay attention to personnel information in an area. Crowd counting is favored by many researchers.

We first model the received signal into three parts, which are the Line-of-Sight (LoS) path blockage effect, Multipath (MP) effect on the received signal, and the multipath effect resulting from signal reflection by the fixed objects. Then, we analyze the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the received signal based on the characteristic function and then combine two different distributions to characterize the relationship between the number of persons and the PDF of the received signal amplitude.

joint tof and doppler estimation for reflection path under the wi-fi ttw scenario,2021.0,0.0,"In recent years, with the popularity of Wi-Fi, the wireless sensing technology based on Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) has become a research hotspot. The signal propagates through multiple paths, the signal of each path, especially generated by the reflection of reflector, will carry rich environmental information. The reflection path is used to obtain many parameters, such as time of flight (ToF) and Doppler shift, for purposes such as target positioning or gesture recognition. The core lies in the CSI based sensing technology is the signal parameter estimation, especially signal ToF, which describes the transmission distance of the signal. At present, many researchers have tried to use ToF to achieve detection and sensing of target under the line-of-sight (LoS) scenario, but no one tried to use ToF and Doppler to detect the target under the through-the-wall (TTW) scenario. In this paper, we propose a 2-dimensional matrix pencil algorithm, which jointly estimates the reflection’s ToF and Doppler frequency shift, through leveraging the phase differences between subcarriers and CSI packets, respectively, under the TTW scenario.

crowdsourcing-based fingerprinting for indoor location in multi-storey buildings,2021.0,1.0,"The number of available indoor location solutions has been growing, however with insufficient precision, high implementation costs or scalability limitations. As fingerprinting-based methods rely on ubiquitous information in buildings, the need for additional infrastructure is discarded.

This paper proposes an algorithm for the automatic construction of environmental fingerprints on multi-storey buildings, leveraging the information sources available in each scenario. It relies on unlabelled crowdsourced data from users' smartphones. With only the floor plans as input, a demand for most applications, we apply a multimodal approach that joins inertial data, local magnetic field and Wi-Fi signals to construct highly accurate fingerprints. Precise movement estimation is achieved regardless of smartphone usage through Deep Neural Networks, and the transition between floors detected from barometric data. Users' trajectories obtained with Pedestrian Dead Reckoning techniques are partitioned into clusters with Wi-Fi measurements. Straight sections from the same cluster are then compared with subsequence Dynamic Time Warping to search for similarities. From the identified overlapping sections, a particle filter fits each trajectory into the building's floor plans. From all successfully mapped routes, fingerprints labelled with physical locations are finally obtained. Experimental results from an office and a university building show that this solution constructs comparable fingerprints to those acquired manually, thus providing a useful tool for fingerprinting-based solutions automatic setup. © 2013 IEEE.",Crowdsourcing; fingerprinting; indoor location; inertial tracking; magnetic field; multi-storey; unsupervised; Wi-Fi,"Santos R., Leonardo R., Barandas M., Moreira D., Rocha T., Alves P., Oliveira J.P., Gamboa H.",Article,crowdsourcing base fingerprinting indoor location multi storey building number available indoor location solution grow insufficient precision high implementation cost scalability limitation fingerprinting base method rely ubiquitous information building need additional infrastructure discard time consume manual process acquire fingerprint limit applicability scenario propose algorithm automatic construction environmental fingerprint multi storey building leverage information source available scenario rely unlabelled crowdsource user smartphone floor plan input demand application apply multimodal approach join inertial local magnetic field signal construct highly accurate fingerprint precise movement estimation achieve regardless smartphone usage deep neural transition floor detect barometric user trajectory obtain pedestrian dead reckoning technique partition cluster measurement straight section cluster compare subsequence dynamic time warp search similarity identify overlap section particle filter fit trajectory building floor plan successfully map route fingerprint label physical location finally obtain experimental result office university building solution construct comparable fingerprint acquire manually provide useful tool fingerprinting base solution automatic setup crowdsource fingerprinting indoor location inertial tracking magnetic field multi storey unsupervised
an experimental study of deep learning approach for indoor positioning system using wi-fi system,2021.0,0.0,"Global navigation satellite system (GNNS) is known for its capability to detect the whereabouts of any desired target such as vehicles and places. However, there is some disadvantage of these technologies as it can only get a precise location outside of the building because as the signal goes to indoor building, the signal becomes weaker due to attenuation. The Wi-Fi systems are the best alternative to GNNS in an indoor environment since the architecture is massively deployed in many recent buildings. However, Wi-Fi also has its disadvantage where its signal is non-linear due to various factors such as multipath and signal blockage indoors thus limiting the system accuracy. In this paper, a deep learning approach with standalone Wi-Fi technologies will be used to have a precise indoor positioning by using the fingerprinting method. The overall result shows that the average distance error between actual and estimated location is 20-cm and the highest error is 62-cm in an experimental area of 180-cm and 120-cm in x and y axis. This shows that deep learning is a possible method to have accurate and precise indoor positioning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Deep learning; Deep neural network; Fingerprinting; Indoor positioning,"Sa’ahiry A.H.A., Ismail A.H., Kamarudin L.M., Zakaria A., Nishizaki H.",Conference Paper,experimental deep approach indoor positioning global navigation satellite gnns know capability detect whereabout desire target vehicle place disadvantage technology precise location outside building signal go indoor building signal weak attenuation system good alternative gnns indoor environment architecture massively deploy recent building disadvantage signal non linear factor multipath signal blockage indoor limit accuracy deep approach standalone technology precise indoor positioning fingerprinting overall result show average distance error actual estimate location cm high error cm experimental area cm cm x y axis show deep possible accurate precise indoor positioning author(s exclusive license springer nature singapore pte ltd deep deep neural fingerprinting indoor positioning
faster fog computing based over-the-air vehicular updates: a transfer learning approach,2021.0,0.0,"Fog computing is a promising option for time sensitive vehicular over-the-air (OTA) updates, as it can offer enhanced network durability and lower communication delays, versus the cloud. Fog node utilization is non-deterministic, largely owing to vehicular traffic patterns. The resultant over provisioning of resources manifests itself in increased communication and handover delays. Based on an analysis of regional traffic patterns, our proposed algorithm determines the optimal number of fog nodes required for OTA updates. The efficacy of our proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study that considers handover delay, propagation delay, transmission rate and vehicular mobility to predict the OTA update time. We employ a machine learning model for predicting the communication delay between fog devices and vehicles. Using European WiFi hotspot signal strength NYC dataset and 5G dataset, we observe that the proposed approach increases net reserve fog resources by 26.57% on average, and reduces the OTA update time by 5.34%. We test the scalability of our approach by analyzing the performance in terms of average throughput while varying the number of vehicles and OTA update size. The performance of the proposed OTA update scheme on simulations has been corroborated by implementation on a real-world testbed.

edgeloc: a robust and real-time localization system towards heterogeneous iot devices,2021.0,3.0,"Indoor localization has become an essential demand driven by indoor location-based services (ILBSs) for mobile users. With the rising of Internet of Things (IoT), heterogeneous smartphones and wearables have become ubiquitous. However, the ILBSs for heterogeneous IoT devices confront significant challenges, such as received signal strength (RSS) variances caused by hardware heterogeneity, multipath reflections from complex environments and localization time restricted by computation resources. This paper proposes EdgeLoc, a robust and real-time indoor localization system towards heterogeneous IoT devices to solve the above challenges. In particular, the RSS fingerprinting data of Wi-Fi is employed for localization and tackling the heterogeneity of IoT devices in two folds. First, feature-level and signal-level solutions are presented to address the random RSS variances. At the feature level, this works proposes a novel capsule neural network model to efficiently extract incremental features from RSS fingerprinting data. At the signal level, a multi-step dataflow is further devised to process RSS fingerprints into image-like data, which utilizes the feature matrix to reduce absolute sensing errors introduced by hardware heterogeneity. Second, an edge-IoT framework is designed to utilize the edge server to train the deep learning model and further supports real-time localization for heterogeneous IoT devices. Extensive field experiments with over 33,600 data points are conducted to validate the effectiveness of EdgeLoc with a large-scale Wi-Fi fingerprint dataset. The results show that EdgeLoc outperforms the state-of-the-art SAE-CNN method in localization accuracy by up to 14.4%, with an average error of 0.68 m and an average positioning time of 2.05 ms.

airoident - user identification based on analyzing wpa2 encrypted traffic containing search engine interactions,2021.0,0.0,"Most search engines provide search suggestions and autocompletion mechanisms based on the partially typed search string. In order to implement such functionality, frequent requests are being sent to the search engine provider. Recent publications show that there is a risk that the user can be identified by observing the TLS encrypted traffic and analyzing the unencrypted meta data. In this paper we extend this approach to the observation of widely used encrypted WiFi networks in order to estimate the potential privacy impact. Without having access to Layer 3 and 4 meta data, the main challenge of this approach is the identification of potential requests being sent to the search engine. We use a linear regression-based approach to identify candidate packet sequences for the feature extraction. The evaluation is done in an optimal environment (reduced WiFi-traffic) to determine a first tendency and performed using three search engines. In total four different user identification/verification approaches are utilized: M1 identification using a neural network, M2 identification using Manhattan distance, M3 identification using Euclidean distance and M4 verification using a one-class support vector machine (SVM). Our results show a classification performance for 10 different test subjects is ranging from 13.2% using the one-class SVM (M4) to 64.1% using the neural network (M1) for the identical search engine. In comparison to a group of five test subjects it can be seen that M1 provides more scalability in comparison to M2, M3 and M4.

a real-time indoor positioning system based on wi-fi rtt and multi-source information,2021.0,0.0,"In order to solve the problem of locating pedestrians in indoor environments, an indoor real-time high-precision positioning system based on smart phones was constructed. Aiming at the non-line-of-sight and multipath problems in the wireless signal-based indoor positioning technology, a method using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the nonlinear mapping relationship between indoor spatial position and Wi-Fi-FTM ranging information is proposed. At the same time, a fingerprint gray-scale construction method combined with a specific AP location is designed for pedestrian location prediction. Considering the large fluctuations and poor continuity of fingerprint-based positioning results, a particle filter positioning algorithm with adaptive update of state parameters is proposed, which improves the degree of freedom and positioning accuracy of pedestrian positioning. Finally, a large number of tests were conducted in an indoor test environment of about 800 m2. Compared with the traditional fingerprint positioning method, the fusion positioning algorithm based on the CNN network improves the positioning accuracy by about 30%. Compared with the millimeter-level precision optical dynamic calibration system, the particle filter fusion method has 94.2% results less than 1 m, and the average positioning error is 0.41 m. Moreover, in the real indoor environment of a commercial supermarket, it is further verified that the positioning system has high precision and high continuous positioning performance in practical applications, and has great application and promotion value. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Convolutional neural network; Indoor localization; MEMS; Smartphone,"Huang L., Yu B., Li J., Zhang H., Li S., Jia H.",Conference Paper,real time indoor positioning base rtt multi source information order solve problem locate pedestrian indoor environment indoor real time high precision positioning base smart phone construct aim non line sight multipath problem signal base indoor positioning technology deep convolutional neural cnn nonlinear mapping relationship indoor spatial position ftm range information propose time fingerprint gray scale construction combine specific ap location design pedestrian location prediction consider large fluctuation poor continuity fingerprint base positioning result particle filter positioning algorithm adaptive update state parameter propose improve degree freedom position accuracy pedestrian positioning finally large number test conduct indoor test environment m2 compare traditional fingerprint positioning fusion positioning algorithm base cnn improve positioning accuracy compare millimeter level precision optical dynamic calibration particle filter fusion 94.2 result m average positioning error 0.41 m. real indoor environment commercial supermarket verify positioning high precision high continuous positioning practical application great application promotion value author(s exclusive license springer nature singapore pte ltd convolutional neural indoor localization mem smartphone
an improved wireless positioning algorithm based on the lstm network,2021.0,0.0,"Given that the BDS-3 (Beidou System-3) has been accomplished and works well, there are increasing demands for localization and navigation in daily life. However, BDS-3’s signals cannot cover some challenging areas such as urban canyons and indoor environments. To extend the availability of the navigation system, other positioning technologies are required to aid the BDS-3. Wireless fingerprint localization technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 5G, etc.) have attracted lots of attention worldwide due to their ubiquitous and cost-effective characteristics, but there are various challenges such as fingerprints spatial ambiguities, RSS (Received Signal Strength) fluctuations over time and RSS variation caused by devices heterogeneity, which impairs positioning accuracy and precision. By analyzing the relationships hidden in adjacent fingerprints, we utilize the Encoder-Decoder Framework and the sequence-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to convert vulnerable RSS to stable RSS spatial gradient, which can eliminate RSS fluctuation over time and hardware diversity. The sequence-based LSTM also eliminates fingerprint spatial ambiguities using the sequence match. The preliminary experiments show the superiority of the proposed framework over the-state-of-art methods in terms of robustness and precision. Specifically, the proposed framework reduces average positioning errors by 24.68% and decreases the average errors by 36.38% and 6.8% in terms of the resistance to device diversity and RSS fluctuation over time respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Deep learning; Fingerprint; LSTM; Wireless positioning,"Yang X., Chen D., Huai J., Cao X., Zhuang Y.",Conference Paper,improved positioning algorithm base lstm give bds-3 beidou system-3 accomplish work increase demand localization navigation daily life bds-3 signal cover challenging area urban canyon indoor environment extend availability navigation positioning technology require aid bds-3 fingerprint localization technology e.g. bluetooth g etc attract lot attention worldwide ubiquitous cost effective characteristic challenge fingerprint spatial ambiguity rss receive signal strength fluctuation time rss variation cause device heterogeneity impair position accuracy precision analyze relationship hide adjacent fingerprint utilize encoder decoder framework sequence base long short term memory lstm convert vulnerable rss stable rss spatial gradient eliminate rss fluctuation time hardware diversity sequence base lstm eliminate fingerprint spatial ambiguity sequence match preliminary experiment superiority propose framework state art method term robustness precision specifically propose framework reduce average positioning error 24.68 decrease average error 36.38 6.8 term resistance device diversity rss fluctuation time respectively author(s exclusive license springer nature singapore pte ltd deep fingerprint lstm positioning
map matching with wifi-rssi gru indoor room switching classifier,2021.0,0.0,"In recent years, indoor location services have gradually become a new research direction in addition to outdoor location services. Traditionally, WiFi-based indoor location technologies are divided into two categories: (i) using WiFi channel propagation model based on RSSI values for ranging, whose localization error can reach 10~20 m; (ii) using RSSI to establish fingerprint library for fingerprint matching and machine learning algorithms for matching, whose localization error can reach 3~20 m. Existing WiFi-based location technologies are usually applied to position coordinate solving, but the accuracy is not high enough. However, using WiFi-RSSI for indoor room switching pattern recognition will effectively improve the accuracy of map matching. In this paper, we use the gate recurrent unit (GRU) algorithm to determine the user's indoor room switching model from the WiFi RSSI timing data set of the mobile terminal in the indoor room switching scenario, which can effectively correct the traditional Hidden Markov Model (HMM) indoor map matching algorithm and significantly improve the accuracy and stability of the indoor map matching algorithm.

device-free human activity recognition based on channel statement information,2021.0,0.0,"The human activity recognition system has been researched in various technical fields for decades. Nowadays, as WiFi is widely used in homes, using WiFi devices for human activity recognition has become a better choice. In recent years, more and more researchers have begun to use channel state information (CSI) to realize human activity recognition. The CSI features with fine-grained information can show the impact of human activity on the channel. But in the existing CSI-based human activity recognition system, there is an issue. Due to the high proportion of error and noise in the phase information in CSI, the information in CSI is not fully utilized during the processing of CSI data. In this paper, we propose a method for extracting phase information in CSI, so that we can completely extract the effective information in CSI as the input feature of the classifier. Then, we use k-means for feature extraction of main feature data. Finally, we use support vector machines (SVM) to learn features and conduct activity recognition.

improving uwb indoor localization accuracy using sparse fingerprinting and transfer learning,2021.0,0.0,"Indoor localization systems become more and more popular. Several technologies are intensively studied with application to high precision object localization in such environments. Ultra-wideband (UWB) is one of the most promising, as it combines relatively low cost and high localization accuracy, especially compared to Beacon or WiFi. Nevertheless, we noticed that leading UWB systems’ accuracy is far below values declared in the documentation. To improve it, we proposed a transfer learning approach, which combines high localization accuracy with low fingerprinting complexity. We perform very precise fingerprinting in a controlled environment to learn the neural network. When the system is deployed in a new localization, full fingerprinting is not necessary. We demonstrate that thanks to the transfer learning, high localization accuracy can be maintained when only 7% of fingerprinting samples from a new localization are used to update the neural network, which is very important in practical applications.

towards enhancing spectrum sensing: signal classification using autoencoders,2021.0,0.0,"The demand for technologies relying on the radio spectrum, such as mobile communications and IoT, has been growing exponentially. As a consequence, providing access to the radio spectrum is becoming increasingly more important. The ever-growing wireless traffic and the increasing scarcity of available spectrum warrants efficient management of the radio spectrum. At the same time, machine learning (ML) is becoming ubiquitous and has found applications in many fields for its ability to identify patterns and assist with decision-making processes. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been used to address challenges in the wireless communications domain, such as radio spectrum sensing, and have shown better performance than traditional sensing methods, such as energy detection. Spectrum sensing, a method for detecting and identifying different wireless signals being transmitted in the same band of the radio spectrum, is crucial for improving dynamic spectrum sharing, which has the potential to enhance sharing and coexistence of different wireless technologies in the same frequency band and ultimately improve spectrum efficiency. To this end, this research evaluates different types of autoencoders, such as deep, variational and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoders, to identify and differentiate between LTE and Wi-Fi transmissions. The goal is to investigate the performance of the different types of autoencoders on an I/Q dataset consisting of LTE and a combination of Wi-Fi signals (IEEE 802.11ax and IEEE 802.11ac) for the classification task in terms of complexity, precision, and recall to identify the best algorithm.

towards long-term effective and robust device-free indoor localization via channel state information,2021.0,0.0,"With the rapid development of location-based IoT applications in recent years, indoor device-free passive localization based on Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) has attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we propose a long-term effective, robust, and accurate device-free passive fingerprinting localization scheme LTLoc, which only requires a single communication link. It takes the amplitudes extracted from the CSI along with the calibrated phases as fingerprints and trains a deep neural network (DNN) regression model to estimate the target location. Since Wi-Fi signals are susceptible to various environmental factors, CSI fingerprints also change over time, making the performance of the localization model built with the fingerprint database drop dramatically over a long period, and recalibrating the entire positioning area is laborious and timeconsuming. To address this problem, we design an adaptive deep neural network (AdaptDNN) based on meta-networks by combining deep learning and domain adaptive methods. It can use meta-network learning to determine which layers and features of the DNN need to be transferred to automatically adapt to CSI fingerprints change. Extensive evaluations in an indoor environment with significantly different CSI fingerprints over six days have shown that LTLoc&#x2019;s effectiveness in coping with changing CSI fingerprints over a long period is significantly superior to existing work in terms of localization and adaptability.

deep learning-based packet detection and carrier frequency offset estimation in ieee 802.11ah,2021.0,0.0,"Wi-Fi systems based on the IEEE 802.11 standards are the most popular wireless interfaces that use Listen Before Talk (LBT) method for channel access. The distinctive feature of a majority of LBT-based systems is that the transmitters use preambles that precede the data to allow the receivers to perform packet detection and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation. Preambles usually contain repetitions of training symbols with good correlation properties, while conventional digital receivers apply correlation-based methods for both packet detection and CFO estimation. However, in recent years, data-based machine learning methods are disrupting physical layer research. Promising results have been presented, in particular, in the domain of deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation. In this paper, we present a performance and complexity analysis of packet detection and CFO estimation using both the conventional and the DL-based approaches. The goal of the study is to investigate under which conditions the performance of the DL-based methods approach or even surpass the conventional methods, but also, under which conditions their performance is inferior.

category-based 802.11ax target wake time solution,2021.0,0.0,"IEEE 802.11ax newly introduced Target Wake Time (TWT) function which enables joint reduction of device power consumption and wireless medium congestion through negotiated TWT wake interval and duration. We develop a novel solution which can dynamically configure station (STA) wake interval and duration based on run time recognition of the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement including the required latency and throughput. Specifically, a Machine Learning (ML) based Network Service Detection (NSD) module is developed which can detect the current network service in real time and update the STA wake interval according to the corresponding service latency requirement. Moreover, a novel data time estimation model is developed which can estimate the required throughput and wake duration with the observed throughput, linkspeed, and contention level. In addition, a state-machine based method is developed to detect three different traffic types (random, stable, bursty) and their throughput variation pattern for further optimization of the STA wake duration. Our solution is implemented and extensively tested on commercial smart mobile platform under various network conditions and use cases. The results show that our ML based NSD could reach 99.2% and 96.5% accuracy respectively for coarse-grain and fine-grain network service classification, which ensures our TWT solution can accurately recognize and satisfy the QoS requirements. More importantly, while maintaining the QoS and user experience, our solution can substantially reduce the Wi-Fi duty cycle to 29.6% on average, which leads to lower device power consumption and network contention level. © 2013 IEEE.",802.11ax; Machine learning; Service classification; Target wake time; Traffic detection,"Qiu W., Chen G., Nguyen K.N., Sehgal A., Nayak P., Choi J.",Article,category base 802.11ax target wake time solution 802.11ax newly introduce target wake time twt function enable joint reduction device power consumption medium congestion negotiate twt wake interval duration develop novel solution dynamically configure station sta wake interval duration base run time recognition quality service qos requirement include required latency throughput specifically machine ml base service detection nsd module develop detect current service real time update sta wake interval accord corresponding service latency requirement novel time estimation model develop estimate require throughput wake duration observed throughput linkspeed contention level addition state machine base develop detect different traffic type random stable bursty throughput variation pattern optimization sta wake duration solution implement extensively test commercial smart mobile platform condition use case result ml base nsd reach 99.2 96.5 accuracy respectively coarse grain fine grain service classification ensure twt solution accurately recognize satisfy qos requirement importantly maintain qos user experience solution substantially reduce duty cycle 29.6 average lead low device power consumption contention level 802.11ax machine service classification target wake time traffic detection
gait and respiration based user identification using wi-fi signal,2021.0,0.0,"The ever-growing security issues in various scenarios create an urgent demand for a reliable and convenient identification system. Traditional identification systems request users to provide passwords, fingerprints or other easily stolen information. Existing works show that everyone&#x2019;s gait and respiration have unique characteristics and are difficult to imitate. But these works only use gait or respiration information to achieve identification, which leads to low accuracy or long identification time. And they have no strong anti-interference ability, which leads to the limitation in practical application. Toward this end, we propose a new system which uses both Gait and Respiratory biometric characteristics to achieve user identification using Wi-Fi (GRi-Fi) in the presence of interferences. In our system, we design a segmentation algorithm to segment gait and respiration data. And we design a weighted subcarrier screening method to improve the anti-interference ability. In order to shorten the identification time, we propose a feature integration method based on weighted average. Finally, we use a deep learning method to identify users accurately. Experimental results show that GRi-Fi can identify the user&#x2019;s identity with an average accuracy of 98.3% in non-interference environments. Even in the presence of multiple interferences, the average identification accuracy also reaches 91.2%. In future applications, our system can be applied to many fields of IoT, such as smart home systems and clocking in at companies.

ensemble strategy utilizing a broad learning system for indoor fingerprint localization,2021.0,0.0,"Indoor positioning technology based on Wi-Fi fingerprint recognition has been widely studied owing to the pervasiveness of hardware facilities and the ease of implementation of software technology. However, the similarity-based method is not sufficiently accurate, whereas the offline training of the neural network-based method is overly time-consuming. An efficient model with high positioning accuracy is therefore not yet available. We propose a stacking Ensemble Broad Learning Localization system using Channel State Information as a fingerprint, which is termed EnsemLoca. A bootstrapping method is used to build the training set, which enables the EnsemLoca system to build the base learner in parallel by using bagging. Broad Learning System (BLS), which is a novel neural network model, as a base learner not only has the advantage of time complexity, but also offers a sparse representation in which the features are filtered. A unique base learner is constructed by randomly selecting the samples and features, and they are combined by stack generalization. The experimental results show that the EnsemLoca system achieves higher accuracy than several machine-learning algorithms in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight environments, and is even stronger than deep neural networks characterized by accuracy. At the same time, it has the same theoretical complexity as BLS, which greatly reduces the offline training time.

wi-sense: a passive human activity recognition system using wi-fi and convolutional neural network and its integration in health information systems,2021.0,1.0,"A human activity recognition (HAR) system acts as the backbone of many human-centric applications, such as active assisted living and in-home monitoring for elderly and physically impaired people. Although existing Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition methods report good results, their performance is affected by the changes in the ambient environment. In this work, we present Wi-Sense—a human activity recognition system that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize human activities based on the environment-independent fingerprints extracted from the Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). First, Wi-Sense captures the CSI by using a standard Wi-Fi network interface card. Wi-Sense applies the CSI ratio method to reduce the noise and the impact of the phase offset. In addition, it applies the principal component analysis to remove redundant information. This step not only reduces the data dimension but also removes the environmental impact. Thereafter, we compute the processed data spectrogram which reveals environment-independent time-variant micro-Doppler fingerprints of the performed activity. We use these spectrogram images to train a CNN. We evaluate our approach by using a human activity data set collected from nine volunteers in an indoor environment. Our results show that Wi-Sense can recognize these activities with an overall accuracy of 97.78%. To stress on the applicability of the proposed Wi-Sense system, we provide an overview of the standards involved in the health information systems and systematically describe how Wi-Sense HAR system can be integrated into the eHealth infrastructure. © 2021, The Author(s).",Channel state information; Convolutional neural network; Doppler effect; Health information systems; Human activity recognition; Principal component analysis; Radio frequency sensing; Spectrogram,"Muaaz M., Chelli A., Gerdes M.W., Pätzold M.",Article,sense passive human activity recognition convolutional neural integration health information system human activity recognition har act backbone human centric application active assisted living home monitoring elderly physically impaired people exist base human activity recognition method report good result affect change ambient environment work present sense human activity recognition use convolutional neural cnn recognize human activity base environment independent fingerprint extract channel state information csi sense capture csi standard interface card sense apply csi ratio reduce noise impact phase offset addition apply principal component remove redundant information step reduce dimension remove environmental impact compute process spectrogram reveal environment independent time variant micro doppler fingerprint perform activity use spectrogram image train cnn evaluate approach human activity set collect volunteer indoor environment result sense recognize activity overall accuracy 97.78 stress applicability propose sense provide overview standard involve health information system systematically describe sense har integrate ehealth infrastructure author(s channel state information convolutional neural doppler effect health information system human activity recognition principal component radio frequency sensing spectrogram
sleep apnea monitoring system based on commodity wifi devices,2021.0,0.0,"To address the limitations of traditional sleep monitoring methods that highly rely on sleeping posture without considering sleep apnea, an intelligent apnea monitoring system is designed based on commodityWiFi in this paper. By utilizing linear fitting and wavelet transform, the phase error of channel state information (CSI) of the receiving antenna is eliminated, and the noise of the signal amplitude is removed.Moreover, the short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) and sliding window method are combined to segment received wireless signals. Finally, several important statistical characteristics are extracted, and a back propagation (BP) neural network model is built to identify apnea state. Thus, interferences caused by changes of sleeping posture are eliminated. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can identify apnea state with an accuracy of over 95.6%. Furthermore, the accuracy can still reach more than 94.8%when the test environment layout is changed. Therefore, the proposed system can be used as a daily apnea monitoring system at home and provide users with health information. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

enhanced fingerprinting based indoor positioning using machine learning,2021.0,0.0,"Due to the inability of the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals to penetrate through surfaces like roofs, walls, and other objects in indoor environments, numerous alternativemethods for user positioning have been presented. Amongst those, the Wi-Fi fingerprinting method has gained considerable interest in Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) as the need for lineof- sight measurements is minimal, and it achieves better efficiency in even complex indoor environments. Offline and online are the two phases of the fingerprinting method.Many researchers have highlighted the problems in the offline phase as it deals with huge datasets and validation of Fingerprints without pre-processing of data becomes a concern. Machine learning is used for the model training in the offline phase while the locations are estimated in the online phase. Many researchers have considered the concerns in the offline phase as it deals with huge datasets and validation of Fingerprints becomes an issue. Machine learning algorithms are a natural solution for winnowing through large datasets and determining the significant fragments of information for localization, creating precise models to predict an indoor location. Large training sets are a key for obtaining better results in machine learning problems. Therefore, an existing WLAN fingerprinting-based multistory building location database has been used with 21049 samples including 19938 training and 1111 testing samples.The proposed model consists of mean and median filtering as pre-processing techniques applied to the database for enhancing the accuracy by mitigating the impact of environmental dispersion and investigated machine learning algorithms (kNN, WkNN, FSkNN, and SVM) for estimating the location.

a hybrid indoor positioning algorithm for cellular and wi-fi networks,2021.0,0.0,"Modern communication services are developing rapidly, and indoor positioning technologies are diverse. However, the accuracy of single algorithm cannot meet the actual requirements. To address this issue, an hybrid indoor positioning algorithm for cellular and Wi-Fi networks is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases, namely the offline phase and the online phase. In the offline phase, a fingerprint database is reconstructed by principal component analysis (PCA) and interpolation methods to reduce the costs of time. Then, in the online phase, the back propagation (BP) neural network positioning algorithm optimized by adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA-BP) is used for positioning. Moreover, the algorithm uses cellular network positioning to divide sub-regions and then uses Wi-Fi networks to further improve accuracy. The experimental results show that the average positioning error of the proposed hybrid algorithm is 1.70 m, which is 56.0% lower than using Wi-Fi network only. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.",Cellular and Wi-Fi networks; Indoor positioning; Reconstruct database; The BP neural network algorithm,"Guo T., Chai M., Xiao J., Li C.",Article,hybrid indoor positioning algorithm cellular modern communication service develop rapidly indoor positioning technology diverse accuracy single algorithm meet actual requirement address issue hybrid indoor positioning algorithm cellular propose propose algorithm consist phase offline phase online phase offline phase fingerprint database reconstruct principal component pca interpolation method reduce cost time online phase propagation bp neural positioning algorithm optimize adaptive genetic algorithm aga bp positioning algorithm use cellular positioning divide sub region use improve accuracy experimental result average positioning error propose hybrid algorithm 1.70   m 56.0 low king fahd university petroleum mineral cellular indoor positioning reconstruct database bp neural algorithm
real-time location fingerprinting for mobile devices in an indoor prison setting,2021.0,0.0,"Many correctional facilities suffer from the smuggling of cell phones and other wireless devices into prison walls. In order to locate these devices for confiscation, we must be able to map intercepted signals to indoor locations within a few meter radius. We chose to use cell phones of varying models and multiple low-cost software-defined radios for this task. The different types of cell phones provide us with a more robust dataset for location fingerprinting due to the different transmitter hardware in each. Furthermore, the SDRs allow us to easily receive the raw IQ data from WiFi signals while being more cost-efficient for smaller facilities. This raw data is collected from a harsh prison-like environment in a grid pattern and associated with the location they were captured. An advanced machine learning network uses the raw signals as input and locations as labels in order to map the signals to their respective locations. The accuracy of our system is then compared and discussed against prior works in this field. These studies often use values other than the raw IQ data such as channel state information and received signal strength indicator. Therefore, we augment our original input with each of these values and measure their effect on the system's overall performance.

a new concept of product design by involving emotional factors using eeg: a case study of xomputer mouse design,2021.0,2.0,"Background: Material/ Methods: Results: Conclusions: Product design has long been developed based on reliability and usability, but has neglected the objective measurement in terms of pleasurable experience. This paper presents a new concept of product design, with application in computer mouse design, which not only considers the performance of its functional factor but also emotional factor. A survey involving 153 respondents showed that 75.16% of respondents consider ergonomic / comfort factor as the most important factor, followed by precision factor with 58.17%, and noise factor with 15.03%. Furthermore, a survey of pairewise comparisons were conducted to assess the level of importance of the emotional factor. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to process weightage, resulting in stress = 0.27, focus = 0.279, engagement = 0.29, and interest = 0.265. Finally, the emotional level of 5 different mouse units was assessed through experiments using the EEG Emotiv 16 Channels system 10-20. There are three stages in assessing the mouse which were carried out using the 5 samples, namely the level of interest, the stage of using (ergonomics, focus) t, and the stage of user experience (engagement). From the average measurement of the EEG value, it was found that interest = 57.8 (scale 0-100) on a mouse that has an elegant shape, striking color, and with wifi connectivity, focus & stress because the size fits the shape of the hand and the level of cursor precision, while engagement follows the other three emotional factors. It can be concluded that brain signal exploration through Emotiv’s EEG is able to quantify the emotional factor in product selection through the phase of attraction, use and experience. © 2021, MedSportPress.

filtered leakage current measurement for various loads,2021.0,1.0,"Thepurpose of this study was to determine the link between induction voltages from various electrical loads. We used a residual current device (RCD) circuit that operates with a capacitor as a DC voltage reading tool. The circuit reads the value of the leakage current generated by the sensing coil from the RCD. It also uses the Blynk framework as an online monitoring system and a WeMos D1-R2 microcontroller to connect to the server using Wi-Fi. Using this system, the dataset was collected in a Python server and utilized with a machine learning technique to draw a correlation between the load power and reading voltage. This will help improve the mistakes of a common RCD cut-off point, which is usually defined only at a specific induced voltage. For the different types, an LED lamp and typical electric fan were used as loads in the experiment. Meanwhile, for a similar type of load, three different LED lamps were characterized using machine learning to show the correlation. From the comparison, a threshold voltage of around 1V and three different gradients with increases of more than 10% are found for LED lamps with loads of 3W, 5W, and 9W.The results show that the relationship depends on the type of its power supply. © 2021, International Journal of Technology.

extracting information from wi-fi traffic on public transport,2021.0,0.0,"The utilization and the quality of public transport are important for the customers, maintainers and service providers. Passive measurement techniques, when humans are not involved are the cheapest way for collecting large amounts of long-Term data from multiple public transport lines. Useful data can be collected from various sources, such as from cameras, infrared sensors and Wi-Fi routers. We addressed the problems of estimating passenger counts in two different ways, and also to get travel statistics like the number of passengers getting on or off a vehicle at a bus stop; and even to compute an origin-destination matrix from Wi-Fi monitoring data. In this study, we focus on Wi-Fi data, which can be still useful for extracting relevant data after many years. Here we describe Wi-Fi data collection methods, and then prove the usefulness of applying simple artificial intelligence-based methods to extract information from the huge amount of Wi-Fi data. We will also show that 'lower-level re-estimation' can be useful for further optimization, which means that globally modelled data may have to be re-modelled on partially selected groups to get better results. Namely, after building linear models and estimating absolute and relative errors, we found that the relative error of the Wi-Fi-based estimation can be markedly reduced if data are processed and analysed in more detail. When a daily Wi-Fi analysis is split into between-stops parts, an additive linear correction can be computed and applied to these parts, and as a result, the relative error of estimates can be reduced. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

inversion of artificial neural networks for wifi rssi propagation modeling,2021.0,0.0,"Wireless communication via access points has rapidly become widespread in almost all aspects of human life. There is an abundance of Wi-Fi access points in almost every building. Wi-Fi positioning systems take advantage of the widespread use of the access points. Wi-Fi based indoor positioning techniques use Wi-Fi fingerprinting to record the propagated signal of individual access points. Recording the data of the propagation models can be used to build a fingerprinting radio map. The built fingerprinting radio maps consist of a set of coordinates, and an access point radio signal strength indication. Artificial Neural networks have proven to be one of the most useful prediction methods, given a big data set. Inversion of Artificial Neural Network models is the process of creating a model that is capable of predicting a set of possible inputs from a given output. The inversion of the neural network which has been trained on the fingerprinting data set can create a novel positioning method. Received signal strength indication can be inverted into a set of coordinates.

secure and dynamic access control for the internet of things (iot) based traffic system,2021.0,2.0,"Today, the trend of the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasing through the use of smart devices, vehicular networks, and household devices with internet-based networks. Specifically, the IoT smart devices and gadgets used in government and military are crucial to operational success. Communication and data sharing between these devices have increased in several ways. Similarly, the threats of information breaches between communication channels have also surged significantly, making data security a challenging task. In this context, access control is an approach that can secure data by restricting unauthorized users. Various access control models exist that can effectively implement access control yet, and there is no single state-of-the- art model that can provide dynamicity, security, ease of administration, and rapid execution all at once. In combating this loophole, we propose a novel secure and dynamic access control (SDAC) model for the IoT networks (smart traffic control and roadside parking management). Our proposed model allows IoT devices to communicate and share information through a secure means by using wired and wireless networks (Cellular Networks or Wi-Fi). The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model are demonstrated using mathematical models and discussed with many example implementations.

device-free human activity recognition based on gmm-hmm using channel state information,2021.0,1.0,"This paper presents a machine learning method, Gaussian Mixture Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM), for device-free activity recognition using WiFi channel state information (CSI). The basic concept of CSI is introduced and signal changes caused by human activity are described, which demonstrates that human activity can be identified using a unique mapping between action and signal variations. The phase difference expanded matrix is built by the mean and standard deviation of phase difference as feature matrix after linear correction and Savitzky-Golay filter is performed on the CSI raw phase information. The GMM-HMM is used for classification as the human activity can be modeled as the Markov process and the complex activity patterns can be fitted by multiple Gaussian density functions, respectively. The proposed system is verified on the self-collected datasets and several factors affecting the recognition accuracy are analyzed. Furthermore, the system has compared with the previous work. High accuracy and robustness in universal scenarios are realized.

safemobility: an iot-based system for safer mobility using machine learning in the age of covid-19,2021.0,2.0,"In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the absence of a vaccine or an effective treatment against the virus, the available studies show that today, the most effective measure for prevention continues to be social distancing. In this sense, in this article, we focus implementing an IoT-based System for safer mobility in the age of COVID-19 using machine learning called SafeMobility. This system has been designed to monitor in real-time the social distancing between people and control the capacity in common interior spaces via a multilayer architecture that integrates IoT, fog, and cloud solutions. To control the capacity safely, we have detected the location of people using machine learning models. We have trained and evaluated these models from a data set containing the RSSI signals of the different surrounding WiFi networks obtained via a portable IoT device. Besides, this portable device integrated with a high precision laser sensor has also been used to detect the distance between people, thus avoiding potential infections. Also, we have exploited the advantages of fog computing to perform data processing and analysis in a fog node using the machine learning model that presented the highest accuracy in the evaluation. In case of non-compliance with the allowed social distance or the established peak capacity, alert messages are sent via a lightweight and optimal protocol in using IoT applications. A web application hosted on a cloud server receives the information from the fog node in real-time and dynamically displays the congestion sites in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the system to determine the position of the people with an accuracy of 91%. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The manufacturer has revolutionized the stages of product lifecycle including process planning and maintenance for the early detection of potential system failures and proactive management. Technological advancements including big data, the cloud, and the Internet of Things have applied digital-twin for industrial practice. It has low-power wireless-enabled devices to play a vital role in various industrial automation systems such as industry logistics, portable equipment, and intelligent wireless monitoring. It is evident that industrial manufacturers are nowadays aiming to transform the machine into fully automated systems that not only control the operation of the equipment but also try to meet the demand of future markets effectively. One of the challenging issues in the automation of the machinery process is the deployment of reliable systems to analyze the machinery condition such as fault diagnosis.

random forest and interpolation techniques for fingerprint-based indoor positioning system in un-ideal environment,2021.0,1.0,"The development of location-based service (LBS) in outdoor environments relies on Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to determine the location. However, for indoor LBS, GPS is not reliable because it has low accuracy for indoor environments. Therefore, it is necessary to have an indoor positioning system (IPS) for indoor LBS. Wi-Fi-based IPS research is growing along with the many uses and availability of Wi-Fi. For static indoor environments, fingerprinting techniques have better accuracy than distance-based approaches such as trilateration and min-max. The fingerprint technique can also be applied by utilizing simple and straightforward parameters, i.e., received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Some of the fingerprint technique's challenges are the length of time, effort, and high cost of collecting the database. In this study, we apply the interpolation techniques to reduce time and effort in collecting fingerprint data. The interpolation used is the Neville interpolation and Bilinear interpolation. Comparing the positioning results between the classical pattern matching algorithm, minimum Euclidean distance (MED), and modern machine learning-based, the Random Forest algorithm, is discussed in detail. We conducted a measurement campaign in an unideal indoor environment to see how far our proposed method can still handle the fluctuated values of RSSI. From several measurements and scenarios presented in this study, the MED algorithm is still better in accuracy and precision than the random forest algorithm. However, in almost all scenarios, the Random Forest can better perform MED in terms of decreasing the maximum estimated error. The accuracy and precision between MED and random forest are up to 0.5 meters, and the precision difference is up to 20%. Performance improvements due to using database interpolation range from 3% to 30%. The database from the interpolation results is also acceptable in the performance metric of the positioning system. However, using the database from the actual position is better and outperformed the database from interpolation results. The low similarity of actual database and database synthesis from interpolation is due to the non-linear and fluctuated RSSI values in our measurements due to the unstable and time-varying effects. © 2021 University of Bahrain.

using smart-wifi thermostat data to improve prediction of residential energy consumption and estimation of savings,2021.0,3.0,"Energy savings based upon use of smart WiFi thermostats ranging from 10 to 15% have been documented, as new features such as geofencing have been added. Here, a new benefit of smart WiFi thermostats is identified and investigated; namely, as a tool to improve the estimation accuracy of residential energy consumption and, as a result, estimation of energy savings from energy system upgrades, when only monthly energy consumption is metered. This is made possible from the higher sampling frequency of smart WiFi thermostats. In this study, collected smart WiFi data are combined with outdoor temperature data and known residential geometrical and energy characteristics. Most importantly, unique power spectra are developed for over 100 individual residences from the measured thermostat indoor temperature in each and used as a predictor in the training of a singular machine learning models to predict consumption in any residence. The best model yielded a percentage mean absolute error (MAE) for monthly gas consumption ±8.6%. Applied to two residences to which attic insulation was added, the resolvable energy savings percentage is shown to be approximately 5% for any residence, representing an improvement in the ASHRAE recommended approach for estimating savings from whole-building energy consumption that is deemed incapable at best of resolving savings less than 10% of total consumption.

ann feature scaling based k-nearest neighbor algorithm for indoor localization,2021.0,0.0,"The Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprint based localization system has become one of the most competitive solutions in the field of indoor localization. The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm is popularly used in the localization system, due to its simplicity for implementation. However, traditional kNN algorithm might fail to consider the variability of correspondence between geometrical location and the similarity of received-signal-strength (RSS) vectors using Euclid distance. In the light of feature scaling kNN (FS-kNN) and continuous feature scaling kNN (CFS-kNN) algorithms, a novel indoor localization algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm maps the similarity of each pair of RSS vectors to their geometrical distance without the ambiguous boundary that might yield in FS-kNN. To avoid the ambiguous boundary, the proposed algorithm determines the weights continuously by an artificial neural network (ANN) that can be trained via some samples. The conditions to guarantee the validity of this algorithm are discussed as well. The proposed algorithm can be used in eigher gridless or grid based RSS matching methods of indoor localization. In our experiment, the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than RADAR, FS-kNN and CFS-kNN, in term of accuracy. Moreover, ANN is more flexible and reasonable than other fixed structure schemes to determine the weights used in the feature-scaling based algorithms. The algorithm is easy to realize in engineering as well. © 2021 IEEE.",Artificial neural net-work; Feature-scaling; Indoor Localization; RSS; Wi-Fi,"Rong R., Fu Y., Zhang X., Xu J., Xiong S.",Conference Paper,ann feature scaling base k near neighbor algorithm indoor localization radio frequency rf fingerprint base localization competitive solution field indoor localization k near neighbor knn algorithm popularly localization simplicity implementation traditional knn algorithm fail consider variability correspondence geometrical location similarity receive signal strength rss vector euclid distance light feature scaling knn fs knn continuous feature scaling knn cfs knn algorithm novel indoor localization algorithm propose algorithm map similarity pair rss vector geometrical distance ambiguous boundary yield fs knn avoid ambiguous boundary propose algorithm determine weight continuously artificial neural ann train sample condition guarantee validity algorithm discuss propose algorithm eigher gridless grid base rss matching method indoor localization experiment propose algorithm well radar fs knn cfs knn term accuracy ann flexible reasonable fix structure scheme determine weight feature scaling base algorithm algorithm easy realize engineering artificial neural net work feature scaling indoor localization rss
smart walking assistant (swa) for elderly care using an intelligent realtime hybrid model,2021.0,0.0,"This work implements a fall and posture detection system exploiting low cost sensors and applying machine learning to aid people in need both at indoor and outdoor. This intelligent system is able to identify fall with and without recovery within a stipulated period of time. In case of fall without recovery, an alert message along with date, time and location of fall is sent to relative/caregiver. This feature ensures real time assistance to avoid any criticality due to delay. In addition to this, an immediate last posture before the fall is also notified to identify the proneness of a person towards fall from a specific posture. This may aid clinical persons to take appropriate measures to prevent the future fall. The system is also able to take care of an unresponsive device after a fall (if any). We have designed and implemented this intelligent live fall with posture detection system, exploiting the sensors in micro processor unit (MPU) 6050 combined with low cost ESP 8266 micro-controller unit (MCU) using WiFi connectivity.

indoor floor localization based on multi-intelligent sensors,2021.0,0.0,"With the continuous expansion of the market of indoor localization, the requirements of indoor localization technology are becoming higher and higher. Existing indoor floor localization (IFL) systems based on Wi-Fi signal and barometer data are susceptible to external environment changes, resulting in large errors. A method for indoor floor localization using multiple intelligent sensors (MIS-IFL) is proposed to decrease the localization errors, which consists of a fingerprint database construction phase and a floor localization phase. In the fingerprint database construction phase, data acquisition is performed using magnetometer sensor, accelerator sensor and gyro sensor in the smartphone. In the floor localization phase, an active pattern recognition is performed through the collaborative work of multiple intelligent sensors and machine learning classifiers. Then floor localization is performed using magnetic data mapping, Euclidean closest approximation and majority principle. Finally, the inter-floor detection link based on machine learning is added to improve the overall localization accuracy of MIS-IFL. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to the existing IFL. © 2020 by the authors.

Smart cities are automated and more sustainable cities, considering that technology is fundamental, but it is only a means to resolve a set of urban issues and attain purpose and goals that are increasingly essentials for large urban centers. This is achieved through the employment of advanced ICT (Information and Communications Technology) to stimulate sustainable development, and improvement in the quality of life, in which everything becomes connected. Through this, for example, it is possible to count on the fastest free public WiFi, i.e., high-speed internet for all residents and visitors and the interconnected functioning of traffic, lighting, public transport systems, among others. There are also discussions on reducing public spending and transparency in the relationship between government and citizens.

gated recurrent unit with rssis from heterogeneous network for mobile positioning,2021.0,1.0,"Recently, research studies on Location-Based Services (LBSs) based on networks including cellular network and Wi-Fi network have gradually become popular. Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSIs) from the network can be detected and collected by mobile devices to estimate the locations without adopting the Global Positioning System (GPS). Previous research studies utilized the RSSIs of only cellular network or only Wi-Fi network to estimate location, which leads to a two-fold predicament involving error limits of cellular network-based methods and environmental constraints of Wi-Fi network-based methods. In addition, accommodating a highly temporal dependence of RSSI series data, this paper proposed a mobile positioning system based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with RSSIs from the heterogeneous network. GRU learns the temporal correlation of RSSIs and the relationship between RSSIs and GPS coordinates to estimate the locations of mobile devices. A large number of real experiments have been carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has lower errors (i.e., 5.86 m and 75% of errors within 4 m) compared with Neural Network (NN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). © 2021 Junxiang Wang et al.",,"Wang J., Guo C., Wu L.",Article,gate recurrent unit rssis heterogeneous mobile positioning recently study location base service lbss base include cellular gradually popular receive signal strength indicator rssis detect collect mobile device estimate location adopt global positioning gps previous study utilize rssis cellular estimate location lead fold predicament involve error limit cellular base method environmental constraint base method addition accommodate highly temporal dependence rssi series propose mobile positioning base gate recurrent unit gru rssis heterogeneous gru learn temporal correlation rssis relationship rssis gps coordinate estimate location mobile device large number real experiment carry verify propose experimental result demonstrate propose low error i.e. 5.86 m error m compare neural nn recurrent neural rnn long short term memory lstm junxiang wang et al

gesture recognition based on channel state features [基于信道状态特征的手势动作识别技术研究],2021.0,0.0,"Gesture recognition is an important means of interaction between humans and machines, which has a wide range of application scenarios in daily life. Gesture recognition based on wireless signals has become a popular method due to its advantages such as contactless and low cost. In order to solve the shortcomings of the traditional wireless signal gesture recognition algorithm that does not make full use of the phase characteristics of the signal, this paper proposes to use the combination of WiFi channel state information amplitude and phase for gesture recognition. The method first processes the received WiFi signal by subcarrier dimensionality reduction and action extraction, and combines the signal amplitude and phase Combined as features. Machine learning algorithms are used to train and classify the data. The method achieves the recognition of six gestures: one hand forward, one hand backward, one hand left, one hand right, one hand up and one hand down. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the algorithm is 96% and 92% at short and long distances, respectively. © 2021, The Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Sensors and Actuators.

machine learning enabled wi-fi saturation sensing for fair coexistence in unlicensed spectrum,2021.0,3.0,"In the past few years, machine learning (ML) techniques have been extensively applied to provide efficient solutions to complex wireless network problems. As such, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Q-learning based ML techniques are most popular to achieve harmonized coexistence of Wi-Fi with other co-located technologies such as LTE. In the existing coexistence schemes, a co-located technology selects its transmission time based on the level of Wi-Fi traffic generated in its collision domain which is determined by either sniffing the Wi-Fi packets or using a central coordinator that can communicate with the co-located networks to exchange their status and requirements through a collaboration protocol. However, such approaches for sensing traffic status increase cost, complexity, traffic overhead, and reaction time of the coexistence schemes. As a solution to this problem, this work applies a ML-based approach that is capable to determine the saturation status of a Wi-Fi network based on real-time and over-the-air collection of medium occupation statistics about the Wi-Fi frames without the need for decoding. In particular, inter-frame spacing statistics of Wi-Fi frames are used to develop a CNN model that can determine Wi-Fi network saturation. The results demonstrate that the proposed ML-based approach can accurately classify whether a Wi-Fi network is saturated or not. © 2013 IEEE.",coexistence; convolutional neural networks; machine learning; traffic load estimation; unlicensed spectrum; Wi-Fi saturation,"Girmay M., Shahid A., Maglogiannis V., Naudts D., Moerman I.",Article,machine enable saturation sense fair coexistence unlicensed spectrum past year machine ml technique extensively apply provide efficient solution complex problem convolutional neural cnn q base ml technique popular achieve harmonized coexistence co locate technology lte exist coexistence scheme co locate technology select transmission time base level traffic generate collision domain determine sniff packet central coordinator communicate co locate exchange status requirement collaboration protocol approach sense traffic status increase cost complexity traffic overhead reaction time coexistence scheme solution problem work apply ml base approach capable determine saturation status base real time air collection medium occupation statistic frame need decode particular inter frame space statistic frame develop cnn model determine saturation result demonstrate propose ml base approach accurately classify saturate coexistence convolutional neural machine traffic load estimation unlicensed spectrum saturation
eaps: edge-assisted predictive sleep scheduling for 802.11 iot stations,2021.0,1.0,"The broad deployment of 802.11 (a.k.a. Wi-Fi) access points and the significant energy-efficiency improvement of 802.11 transceivers have resulted in increasing interest in building 802.11-based Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Unfortunately, the power saving mechanisms of 802.11 fall short when used in IoT applications, especially because they do not take into account the delays caused by various factors, such as buffering, interference, and round-trip delay. In this article, we present edge-assisted predictive sleep scheduling (EAPS) to adjust the sleep duration of stations while they are expecting downlink packets. We first implement a Linux-based access point that enables us to collect parameters affecting communication latency. Using this access point, we build a testbed that, in addition to offering traffic pattern customization, replicates the characteristics of real-world environments. We then use multiple machine learning algorithms to predict downlink packet delivery. Our empirical evaluations confirm that with EAPS, the energy consumption of IoT stations is as low as power save mode, whereas the delay of packet delivery is close to the case where the station is always awake.

cuckoo search-based svm (cs-svm) model for real-time indoor position estimation in iot networks,2021.0,0.0,"Internet of Things (IoT), an emerging technology, is becoming an essential part of today's world. Machine learning (ML) algorithms play an important role in various applications of IoT. For decades, the location information has been extremely useful for humans to navigate both in outdoor and indoor environments. Wi-Fi access point-based indoor positioning systems get more popularity, as it avoids extra calibration expenses. The fingerprinting technique is preferred in an indoor environment as it does not require a signal's Line of Sight (LoS). It consists of two phases: offline and online phase. In the offline phase, the Wi-Fi RSSI radio map of the site is stored in a database, and in the online phase, the object is localized using the offline database. To avoid the radio map construction which is expensive in terms of labor, time, and cost, machine learning techniques may be used. In this research work, we proposed a hybrid technique using Cuckoo Search-based Support Vector Machine (CS-SVM) for real-time position estimation. Cuckoo search is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm, which solves the problem of slow convergence rate and local minima of other similar algorithms. Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprint dataset of UCI repository having seven classes is used for simulation purposes. The dataset is preprocessed by min-max normalization to increase accuracy and reduce computational speed.

The LBS provide useful information about the person or object’s current position. Among these applications, Global Positioning System (GPS)-based positioning and navigation services have been deployed in an outdoor environment. However, GPS requires being in sight with satellites due to line of sight challenge. The GPS fails in an indoor environment because of multipath effects caused by walls or indoor setup in general.

Similarly, this approach is faced with signal attenuation challenge caused by walls, desks, moving people, or just the indoor setup in general. The collection of the signal strengths without correction can affect positioning accuracy.

fusing rgb and thermal imagery with channel state information for abnormal activity detection using multimodal bidirectional lstm,2021.0,0.0,"In this paper, we present a multimodal deep model for detection of abnormal activity, based on bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (LSTM). The proposed model exploits three different input modalities: RGB imagery, thermographic imagery and Channel State Information from Wi-Fi signal reflectance to estimate human intrusion and suspicious activity. The fused multimodal information is used as input in a Bidirectional LSTM, which has the benefit of being able to capture temporal interdependencies in both past and future time instances, a significant aspect in the discussed unusual activity detection scenario. We also present a Bayesian optimization framework that fine-tunes the Bidirectional LSTM parameters in an optimal manner. The proposed framework is evaluated on real-world data from a critical water infrastructure protection and monitoring scenario and the results indicate a superior performance compared to other unimodal and multimodal approaches and classification models. © 2021, The Author(s).",Abnormal activity detection; Bidirectional LSTM; Critical infrastructure monitoring; Human intrusion; Multimodal data fusion,"Bakalos N., Voulodimos A., Doulamis N., Doulamis A., Papasotiriou K., Bimpas M.",Conference Paper,fuse rgb thermal imagery channel state information abnormal activity detection multimodal bidirectional lstm present multimodal deep model detection abnormal activity base bidirectional long short term memory neural lstm propose model exploit different input modality rgb imagery thermographic imagery channel state information signal reflectance estimate human intrusion suspicious activity fuse multimodal information input bidirectional lstm benefit able capture temporal interdependency past future time instance significant aspect discuss unusual activity detection scenario present bayesian optimization framework fine tune bidirectional lstm parameter optimal manner propose framework evaluate real world critical water infrastructure protection monitoring scenario result indicate superior compare unimodal multimodal approach classification model author(s abnormal activity detection bidirectional lstm critical infrastructure monitoring human intrusion multimodal fusion

network intrusion detection using sparse autoencoder with swish-prelu activation model,2021.0,4.0,"In computer networks, the massive amount of data increases the challenges for intrusion detection systems, because of its high dimensionality. To overcome this problem, a four-phase system is developed for intrusion detection based on encoding techniques and deep learning. In the first phase, input data are collected from NSL-KDD, Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity-Intrusion Detection System 2017 (CIC-IDS2017), and Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID). The collected data are converted into the machine-readable form by using label and one hot encoding technique that reduces the human intervention process and increases the accuracy of data classification. Next, the top percentile and recursive features are selected utilizing second percentile methodology and recursive feature elimination. The undertaken feature selection techniques; second percentile method and recursive feature elimination selects the relevant or active features from the pre-processed data that effectively diminishes the computational time and complexity of the proposed model. In the final phase, sparse autoencoder with swish-PReLU activation model is proposed to classify the normal and traffic types in the NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS2017, and AWID datasets. In the experimental phase, the proposed sparse autoencoder with swish-PReLU activation model achieved effective performance in intrusion detection in light of false alarm rate, detection rate and classification accuracy.

a low cost decentralized future contacts prediction model using wi-fi traces,2021.0,0.0,"The ability to accurately predict human encounters can inspire a variety of promising applications, ranging from epidemiology to data forwarding in opportunistic networks. This work aims at designing a low cost, highly accurate human encounter prediction model based on Wi-Fi datasets. By leveraging the temporal dependency of human mobility, we propose the distributed human encounter prediction (DHEP) model, which uses the Wi-Fi access history and inferred contact information of only the person of interest to estimate future encounters of that person. We implement the proposed DHEP model using a recurrent neural network and a feed-forward neural network. An embedding model that learns the low-dimensional representation of a person&#x0027;s location is proposed to reduce the number of training parameters. The experimental results on two large Wi-Fi datasets show the proposed RNN-based DHEP model outperforms existing models, and achieves 87% to 91% accuracy based on University at Buffalo (UB) traces. We also compare DH P with the centralized human encounter prediction (CHEP) model, which gathers the contact history of all people for predicting future encounters. Despite a slightly lower performance than CHEP, DHEP has a low overhead and can protect data privacy.

classification of abnormal traces in a collaborative fog computing architecture,2021.0,0.0,"A large number of fog nodes located at a network edge not only have the characteristics of resource limitation and clustered location distribution, but also are susceptible to variable intrusion from illegal intruders from outside. For the above fog computing environment, a collaborative fog computing architecture is proposed where a lightweight fog node in each cluster is used to collect data from multiple low-power IoT devices around. This miniature fog computing architecture facilitates integration with the next-generation WiFi communication method, thereby effectively realizing communication and edge perception. Although a single lightweight fog node is difficult to complete the overall perception, the fog computing center can effectively integrate features from multiple lightweight fog nodes, such as radio frequency fingerprinting (RF fingerprinting) features and MAC address information features.

the dark (and bright) side of iot: attacks and countermeasures for identifying smart home devices and services,2021.0,0.0,"We present a new machine learning-based attack that exploits network patterns to detect the presence of smart IoT devices and running services in the WiFi radio spectrum. We perform an extensive measurement campaign of data collection, and we build up a model describing the traffic patterns characterizing three popular IoT smart home devices, i.e., Google Nest Mini, Amazon Echo, and Amazon Echo Dot. We prove that it is possible to detect and identify with overwhelming probability their presence and the services running by the aforementioned devices in a crowded WiFi scenario. This work proves that standard encryption techniques alone are not sufficient to protect the privacy of the end-user, since the network traffic itself exposes the presence of both the device and the associated service. While more work is required to prevent non-trusted third parties to detect and identify the user’s devices, we introduce Eclipse, a technique to mitigate these types of attacks, which reshapes the traffic making the identification of the devices and the associated services similar to the random classification baseline. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Cyberphysical systems; Internet of Things; Machine learning; Privacy; Security,"Hussain A.M., Oligeri G., Voigt T.",Conference Paper,dark bright iot attack countermeasure identify smart home device service present new machine base attack exploit pattern detect presence smart iot device run service radio spectrum perform extensive measurement campaign collection build model describe traffic pattern characterize popular iot smart home device i.e. google nest mini amazon echo amazon echo dot prove possible detect identify overwhelming probability presence service run aforementione device crowded scenario work prove standard encryption technique sufficient protect privacy end user traffic expose presence device associated service work require prevent non trusted party detect identify user device introduce eclipse mitigate type attack reshape traffic make identification device associate service similar random classification baseline springer nature switzerland ag cyberphysical system internet thing machine privacy security
understanding wifi signal frequency features for position-independent gesture sensing,2021.0,2.0,"Recent years have witnessed rapid development in the research area of WiFi sensing, which senses human activities in a contactless and non-intrusive manner. One major issue that hinders real-world deployment of these systems is position dependence, i.e., once the human target changes location and orientation, the sensing performance degrades significantly. Existing machine learning based methods aim to solve this problem by either generating high-dimensional features or transfer learning the environment knowledge. However, these methods require significant training effort and yet acquire limited improvement. In this paper, we start by understanding and analyzing the Doppler frequency shift in WiFi sensing. We then develop a WiFi frequency model to quantify the relationship between signal frequency and target position, motion direction and speed for human activities. Based on this theoretical model, we prove that the commonly-used movement speed and motion direction features are position dependent, and further identify movement fragments and relative motion direction changes as two position-independent features. Building upon the position-independent features, we design a suite of position-independent gestures and develop the gesture recognition system accordingly. Evaluation results show that under various conditions (i.e., different locations, orientations, environments, and persons), our system achieves more than 96% recognition accuracy without any training, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art machine learning based solutions.

human recognition using single-input-single-output channel model and support vector machines,2021.0,1.0,"WiFi based human motion recognition systems mainly rely on the availability of Channel State Information (CSI). Embedded within WiFi devices, the present radio subsystems can output CSI that describes the response of a wireless communication channel. Radio subsystems as such, use complex hardware architectures that consume lots of energy during data transmission, as well as exhibit phase drift in the sub-carriers. Although human motion recognition (HMR) based on multi-carrier transmission systems show better classification accuracy, transmission of multiple sub-carriers results in an increase in the overall energy consumption at the transmitter. Apparently CSI based systems can be perceived as process intensive and power hungry devices. To alleviate the process intensive computing and reduce energy consumption in WiFi, this study proposes a human recognition system that uses only one radio carrier frequency. The study uses two software defined radios and a machine learning classifier to identify four humans, and the study results show that human identification is possible with 99% accuracy using only one radio carrier. The results of this study will have an impact on the development process of smart sensing systems, particularly those that relate to healthcare, authentication, and passive monitoring and sensing. © 2021.

a dnn-based wifi-rssi indoor localization method in iot,2021.0,2.0,"Indoor automatic localization technology is very important for the Internet of Things. With the development of wireless technology and the diversification of location service requirements, especially in complex indoor scenarios, users are increasingly demanding location-based services. Traditional Global Positioning System (GPS) location technology is difficult to solve some positioning problems in indoor environments, and WiFi is now available in most indoor environments. Therefore, using WiFi for positioning does not require additional deployment of hardware devices, which is a very cost-effective method. However, WiFi-based indoor positioning requires a large amount of data, so we can use artificial intelligence methods to analyze the data and obtain a positioning model. The traditional indoor positioning methods based on WiFi signals have some problems such as long positioning time and poor accuracy. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes an indoor localization method based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for WiFi fingerprint. In particular, a DNN-based WiFi-RSSI positioning method is proposed for indoor automatic localization. Besides, in the process of DNN training, a joint training method based on unsupervised learning and supervised learning is adopted and the special loss function is defined.

phishing evolves: analyzing the enduring cybercrime,2021.0,3.0,"Phishing, the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity via electronic communication, has quickly evolved beyond low-skill schemes that relied on casting “a wide net.” Spear phishing attacks target a particular high-value individual utilizing sophisticated techniques. This study aims to describe the current state of phishing, the expected technological advances and developments of the near future, and the best prevention and enforcement strategies. Data comes from interviews with approximately 60 information technology security professionals, “hackers,” and academic researchers. Routine Activity Theory provided an operational framework; while it is an imperfect fit for most crimes, it provides enough explanatory power for cyber-crimes. Interviewees mainly agreed: First, technological advances increase the proliferation of phishing attacks, but also aid in their detection. It has never been easier to conduct a simple attack, but a good attack requires more effort than ever before. Second, phishing is directly responsible financial fraud and, indirectly, as the primary attack vector for ransomware. Third, newer types of attacks utilizing technology, like deepfakes, will make the problem worse in the short-term. Fourth, prevention will come from machine learning and public education akin to WIFI security improvement via the combination of encryption and password awareness. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",routine activities; Technology; theories; victimization,"Ghazi-Tehrani A.K., Pontell H.N.",Article,phishe evolve analyze endure cybercrime phishing fraudulent attempt obtain sensitive information disguise oneself trustworthy entity electronic communication quickly evolve low skill scheme rely cast wide net spear phishe attack target particular high value individual utilize sophisticated technique aim describe current state phishe expect technological advance development near future good prevention enforcement strategy come interview approximately information technology security professional hacker academic researcher routine activity theory provide operational framework imperfect fit crime provide explanatory power cyber crime interviewee mainly agree technological advance increase proliferation phishe attack aid detection easy conduct simple attack good attack require effort second phishe directly responsible financial fraud indirectly primary attack vector ransomware new type attack utilize technology like deepfake problem bad short term fourth prevention come machine public education akin security improvement combination encryption password awareness taylor francis group llc routine activity technology theory victimization
towards fully domain-independent gesture recognition using cots wifi device,2021.0,0.0,"This letter proposes a fully domain-independent WiFi-based gesture recognition system based on the multi-label adversarial network. Unlike pioneer machine learning works, our system does not require retraining in the target domain, which benefits from our key idea of eliminating fully domain information such as orientations, locations, environment information. The system proposed by us includes three parts: Feature extractor, domain discriminator, and gesture recogniser. The feature extractor attempts to deceive the domain discriminator based on the adversarial network structure so that it is difficult to judge the input domain label, thereby obtaining domain-independent features and realising fully domain-independent gesture recognition. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Widar 3.0 dataset and our dataset to evaluate system performance. The results show that our system can achieve an in-domain recognition accuracy of 93.2% and a cross-domain recognition accuracy of 87.1%, which is superior to other state-of-the-art works. © 2021 The Authors.

wi-pigr: path independent gait recognition with commodity wi-fi,2021.0,0.0,"Wi-Fi based gait recognition has many potential applications. However, the gait information derived from Wi-Fi changes with the walking path. This makes the human identification through gait really challenging, the existing Wi-Fi based gait recognition systems require the subject walking along a predetermined path. This path dependence restriction impedes Wi-Fi based gait recognition from being widely used. In this paper, a path independent gait recognition system, Wi-PIGR, is proposed. In Wi-PIGR, the subject is identified through the gait regardless of the walking path. Specifically, an extra receiver is introduced to get CSI data in orthogonal directions. A series of signal processing techniques are proposed to eliminate the differences among signals introduced by walking along the arbitrary paths and generate a high quality path independent signal spectrogram. Furthermore, a deep learning approach is integrated into the feature extraction. The experiment results in typical indoor environment demonstrate the superior performance of Wi-PIGR, with the average recognition accuracy of 77:15%, when the number of subjects is 50.

dscp: depthwise separable convolution-based passive indoor localization using csi fingerprint,2021.0,3.0,"Wi-Fi-based indoor localization has received extensive attention in wireless sensing. However, most Wi-Fi-based indoor localization systems have complex models and high localization delays, which limit the universality of these localization methods. To solve these problems, a depthwise separable convolution-based passive indoor localization system (DSCP) is proposed. DSCP is a lightweight fingerprint-based localization system that includes an offline training phase and an online localization phase. In the offline training phase, the indoor scenario is first divided into different areas to set training locations for collecting CSI. Then, the amplitude differences of these CSI subcarriers are extracted to construct location fingerprints, thereby training the convolutional neural network (CNN). In the online localization phase, CSI data are first collected at the test locations, and then, the location fingerprint is extracted and finally fed to the trained network to obtain the predicted location. The experimental results show that DSCP has a short training time and a low localization delay. DSCP achieves a high localization accuracy, above 97%, and a small median localization distance error of 0.69 m in typical indoor scenarios. © 2021 Chong Han et al.",,"Han C., Xun W., Sun L., Lin Z., Guo J.",Article,dscp depthwise separable convolution base passive indoor localization csi fingerprint base indoor localization receive extensive attention sensing base indoor localization system complex model high localization delay limit universality localization method solve problem depthwise separable convolution base passive indoor localization dscp propose dscp lightweight fingerprint base localization include offline training phase online localization phase offline training phase indoor scenario divide different area set training location collect csi amplitude difference csi subcarrier extract construct location fingerprint train convolutional neural cnn online localization phase csi collect test location location fingerprint extract finally feed train obtain predict location experimental result dscp short training time low localization delay dscp achieve high localization accuracy small median localization distance error 0.69 m typical indoor scenario chong han et al
wi-fi fingerprint-based indoor mobile user localization using deep learning,2021.0,5.0,"In recent years, deep learning has been used for Wi-Fi fingerprint-based localization to achieve a remarkable performance, which is expected to satisfy the increasing requirements of indoor location-based service (LBS). In this paper, we propose a Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor mobile user localization method that integrates a stacked improved sparse autoencoder (SISAE) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). We improve the sparse autoencoder by adding an activity penalty term in its loss function to control the neuron outputs in the hidden layer. The encoders of three improved sparse autoencoders are stacked to obtain high-level feature representations of received signal strength (RSS) vectors, and an SISAE is constructed for localization by adding a logistic regression layer as the output layer to the stacked encoders. Meanwhile, using the previous location coordinates computed by the trained SISAE as extra inputs, an RNN is employed to compute more accurate current location coordinates for mobile users. The experimental results demonstrate that the mean error of the proposed SISAE-RNN for mobile user localization can be reduced to 1.60 m. © 2021 Junhang Bai et al.",,"Bai J., Sun Y., Meng W., Li C.",Article,fingerprint base indoor mobile user localization deep recent year deep fingerprint base localization achieve remarkable expect satisfy increase requirement indoor location base service lbs fingerprint base indoor mobile user localization integrate stack improve sparse autoencod sisae recurrent neural rnn improve sparse autoencod add activity penalty term loss function control neuron output hidden layer encoder improved sparse autoencoder stack obtain high level feature representation receive signal strength rss vector sisae construct localization add logistic regression layer output layer stack encoder previous location coordinate compute train sisae extra input rnn employ compute accurate current location coordinate mobile user experimental result demonstrate mean error propose sisae rnn mobile user localization reduce 1.60 m. junhang bai et al
smartphone based indoor localization using permanent magnets and artificial intelligence for pattern recognition,2021.0,2.0,"Smartphone-based indoor localization methods are frequently employed for position estimation of users inside enclosures like malls, conferences, and crowded venues. Existing solutions extensively use wireless technologies, like Wi-Fi, RFID, and magnetic sensing. However, these approaches depend on the presence of active beacons and suitable mapping surveys of the deployed areas, which render them highly sensitive to the local ambient field clutters. Thus, current localization systems often underperform. We embed small-volume and large-moment magnets in pre-known locations and arrange them in specific geometric forms. Each constellation of magnets creates a super-structure pattern of supervised magnetic signatures. These signatures constitute an unambiguous magnetic environment with respect to the moving sensor carrier. The localization algorithm learns the unique patterns of the scattered magnets during training and detects them from the ongoing streaming of data during localization. Our work innovates regarding two essential features: first, instead of relying on active magnetic transmitters, we deploy passive permanent magnets that do not require a power supply. Second, we perform localization based on smartphone motion rather than on static positioning of the magnetometer. Therefore, we present a novel and unique dynamic indoor localization method combined with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for post-processing.

determination of leaf water content with a portable nirs system based on deep learning and information fusion analysis,2021.0,3.0,"Spectroscopy has been widely used as a valid non-destructive technique for the determination of crop physiological parameters. In this study, a portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system was developed for rapid measurement of rape (Brassica campestris) leaf water content. An integrated spectrometer (900 to 1700 nm) was used to collect the spectra. A Wi-Fi module was adopted for driving the spectrometer and realizing data communication. The NVIDIA Jetson Nano developer kit was employed to handle the received spectra and perform computing tasks. Three embedded spectral analysis models, including support vector regression (SVR), partial least square regression (PLSR), and deep convolutional neural network for regression (CNN-R), and decision fusions of these methods were built and compared. The results demonstrated that the separate models produced satisfactory predictions. The proposed system achieved the highest precision based on the fusion of PLSR and CNN-R.

tracking vital signs of a patient using channel state information and machine learning for a smart healthcare system,2021.0,4.0,"In a smart healthcare system, the sensor-embedded wearable devices have the ability to track various vital signs of a patient. However, such devices need to be worn by the patients all the time. These devices have limitations such as their battery lifetime, charging mechanism, and hardware-related cost. Moreover, these devices transmit a huge amount of redundant and inconsistent data. The transmitted data need to be fused to remove any outlier so that only highly- refined data are available for decision-making. In this paper, we use channel state information (CSI) to track the vital signs of a patient and remove any outliers from the gathered data. We monitor the respiration rate of a patient during sleep with minimal hardware-related cost. Our CSI-based approach no longer requires the patients to wear any wearables and can monitor even the minute fluctuations in a WiFi signal. For extracting useful features from the respiratory data, three types of feature extraction techniques are used. In order to select important features from the extracted feature space, three feature selection algorithms, i.e., Relief, mRMR, and Lasso, have been investigated. In addition, for predicting the health conditions of a patient, four machine learning classification algorithms, i.e., KNN, SVM, DT, and RF, are utilized. The use of CSI ensures that highly refined and fused data are available for feature selection, and the selected features are presented to the ML classification algorithms for predicting the health condition of the patient. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.",Channel state information; Classification; Data fusion; Feature extraction; Feature selection; Machine learning; Smart healthcare system; Vital signs,"Khan M.I., Jan M.A., Muhammad Y., Do D.-T., Rehman A., Mavromoustakis C.X., Pallis E.",Article,track vital sign patient channel state information machine smart healthcare smart healthcare sensor embed wearable device ability track vital sign patient device need wear patient time device limitation battery lifetime charge mechanism hardware relate cost device transmit huge redundant inconsistent transmit need fuse remove outlier highly- refined available decision making use channel state information csi track vital sign patient remove outlier gather monitor respiration rate patient sleep minimal hardware relate cost csi base approach long require patient wear wearable monitor minute fluctuation signal extract useful feature respiratory type feature extraction technique order select important feature extract feature space feature selection algorithm i.e. relief mrmr lasso investigate addition predict health condition patient machine classification algorithm i.e. knn svm dt rf utilize use csi ensure highly refined fuse available feature selection select feature present ml classification algorithm predict health condition patient author(s exclusive licence springer verlag london ltd springer nature channel state information classification fusion feature extraction feature selection machine smart healthcare vital sign
evaluating smartphone accuracy for rssi measurements,2021.0,1.0,"Smartphones are affordable devices nowadays, capable of embedding a large variety of sensors such as magnetometers or orientation sensors, but also the hardware needed to connect them to most wireless communication technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks. Therefore, they are handy devices able to perform received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements for a wide variety of applications such as cellular coverage maps, indoor localization, or proximity tracking. However, to the best of our knowledge, the accuracy of such measurements has never been rigorously assessed. The goals of this article are to assess the accuracy of the RSSI measurements made with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphone in a variety of conditions and how possible inaccuracies can be corrected. We primarily focus on the long-term evolution (LTE) RSSI, but we also extend our results to the Bluetooth RSSI. In this article, we build a controlled experimental setup based on commodity hardware and on open-source software. We evaluate the granularity and limitations of the Android application programming interface (API) that returns the RSSI. We explore how reliable the measurements in a controlled environment with a mono-polarized antenna are. We show that the orientation of the smartphone, the position or orientation of the source, and the transmission power have a significant impact on the accuracy of the measurements. We introduce several correction techniques based on radiation matrix manipulations and on machine learning in order to improve measurement accuracy to less than 5-dBm RMSE, when compared to a professional equipment. We also explore the reliability of measurements made in an outdoor realistic environment. We show that although transmission diversity available in LTE base stations significantly improves the measured RSSI regardless of the smartphone orientation, the Bluetooth RSSI remains largely sensitive to the smartphone orientation. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Accuracy; Bluetooth; calibration; long-term evolution (LTE); received signal strength indicator (RSSI); sensors; smartphone; software-defined radio (SDR),"Boussad Y., Mahfoudi M.N., Legout A., Lizzi L., Ferrero F., Dabbous W.",Article,evaluate smartphone accuracy rssi measurement smartphone affordable device nowadays capable embed large variety sensor magnetometer orientation sensor hardware need connect communication technology bluetooth cellular handy device able perform receive signal strength indicator rssi measurement wide variety application cellular coverage map indoor localization proximity tracking good knowledge accuracy measurement rigorously assess goal article assess accuracy rssi measurement commercial shelf cot smartphone variety condition possible inaccuracy correct primarily focus long term evolution lte rssi extend result bluetooth rssi article build control experimental setup base commodity hardware open source software evaluate granularity limitation android application programming interface api return rssi explore reliable measurement control environment mono polarize antenna orientation smartphone position orientation source transmission power significant impact accuracy measurement introduce correction technique base radiation matrix manipulation machine order improve measurement accuracy dbm rmse compare professional equipment explore reliability measurement outdoor realistic environment transmission diversity available lte station significantly improve measure rssi regardless smartphone orientation bluetooth rssi remain largely sensitive smartphone orientation accuracy bluetooth calibration long term evolution lte receive signal strength indicator rssi sensor smartphone software define radio sdr
a unified methodology to predict wi-fi network usage in smart buildings,2021.0,3.0,"People usually spend several hours per day inside buildings, and they require great amounts of energy and resources to operate. Although there are numerous studies about smart buildings, there is still a need for new intelligent techniques for efficient smart building management. This paper proposes the use of Wi-Fi network association information as a basis for the design of intelligent systems for smart buildings. We propose a unified experimental methodology to evaluate machine learning (ML) models on their capacity to accurately predict Wi-Fi access point demand for energy-efficient smart buildings. The evaluation involves the use of multiple classification and regression models using a variety of configurations and algorithms. We conducted an experimental analysis using our proposed methodology to determine which ML models provide the best performance results using data collected from a large scale Wi-Fi network located at Fluminense Federal University (UFF) over a period of 6 months.

transfersense: towards environment independent and one-shot wifi sensing,2021.0,0.0,"WiFi has recently established itself as a powerful medium for radio frequency (RF) sensing due to its low cost and convenience. Many tasks, such as gesture recognition, activity recognition, and fall detection, can be implemented by measuring and calculating how the propagation of WiFi signals is affected by human activities. However, current WiFi-based sensing solutions have limited scales as they are designed for only a few activities and need to collect data and create training models in the same domain because the model established in a deployment environment is usually not applicable to new objects in the target domain. This paper presents TransferSense, an environment independent and one-shot WiFi sensing method based on deep learning. Firstly, amplitude and phase information of channel state information (CSI) are combined to increase the number of features to solve the problem of insufficient features due to single-source information. Secondly, TransferSense converts RF sensing tasks to image classification tasks and fuses low-level and high-level semantic features extracted from a pre-trained convolutional neural network to achieve an end-to-end high-precision sensing for activity recognition. Finally, TransferSense applies a transfer learning method with a small number of labeled samples in the target domain to perform high-precision cross-domain sensing, which can reduce the data collection cost in the target domain. We verified the effectiveness of TransferSense using two representative WiFi sensing applications, gait identification and sign recognition. In a single deployment environment, TransferSense achieved more than 97% human gait identification accuracy for 44 users and more than 81% sign language recognition for 100 isolated sign language words. In the case of new object recognition in the cross-domain sensing, TransferSense achieved more than 77% human gait identification accuracy for 10 new users, more than 88% sign language recognition for 10 new isolated sign language words, and more than 81% gesture identification for 2 new gestures. © 2021, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Channel state information; Human interaction; Transfer learning; WiFi,"Bu Q., Ming X., Hu J., Zhang T., Feng J., Zhang J.",Article,transfersense environment independent shot sense recently establish powerful medium radio frequency rf sensing low cost convenience task gesture recognition activity recognition fall detection implement measure calculate propagation signal affect human activity current base sensing solution limit scale design activity need collect create training model domain model establish deployment environment usually applicable new object target domain present transfersense environment independent shot sense base deep firstly amplitude phase information channel state information csi combine increase number feature solve problem insufficient feature single source information secondly transfersense convert rf sense task image classification task fuse low level high level semantic feature extract pre train convolutional neural achieve end end high precision sensing activity recognition finally transfersense apply transfer small number label sample target domain perform high precision cross domain sensing reduce collection cost target domain verify effectiveness transfersense representative sensing application gait identification sign recognition single deployment environment transfersense achieve human gait identification accuracy user sign language recognition isolated sign language word case new object recognition cross domain sensing transfersense achieve human gait identification accuracy new user sign language recognition new isolate sign language word gesture identification new gesture springer verlag london ltd springer nature channel state information human interaction transfer
hybrid deep learning model based indoor positioning using wi-fi rssi heat maps for autonomous applications,2021.0,14.0,"Positioning using Wi-Fi received signal strength indication (RSSI) signals is an effective method for identifying the user positions in an indoor scenario. Wi-Fi RSSI signals in an autonomous system can be easily used for vehicle tracking in underground parking. In Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning, the positioning system estimates the signal strength of the access points (APs) to the receiver and identifies the user’s indoor positions. The existing Wi-Fi RSSI based positioning systems use raw RSSI signals obtained from APs and estimate the user positions. These raw RSSI signals can easily fluctuate and be interfered with by the indoor channel conditions. This signal interference in the indoor channel condition reduces localization performance of these existing Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning systems. To enhance their performance and reduce the positioning error, we propose a hybrid deep learning model (HDLM) based indoor positioning system. The proposed HDLM based positioning system uses RSSI heat maps instead of raw RSSI signals from APs. This results in better localization performance for Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning systems. When compared to the existing Wi-Fi RSSI based positioning technologies such as fingerprint, trilateration, and Wi-Fi fusion approaches, the proposed approach achieves reasonably better positioning results for indoor localization. The experiment results show that a combination of convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM) used in the proposed HDLM outperforms other deep learning models and gives a smaller localization error than conventional Wi-Fi RSSI signal based localization approaches. From the experiment result analysis, the proposed system can be easily implemented for autonomous applications. © 2020 by the authors.

improving indoor geomagnetic field fingerprinting using recurrence plot-based convolutional neural networks,2021.0,0.0,"Geomagnetic field fingerprinting is gradually substituting Bluetooth and WiFi fingerprinting since the magnetic field is ubiquitous and independent of any infrastructure. Many studies have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop indoor positioning systems. Most of these networks use actual magnetic values to build fingerprints. The main source of diminished accuracy is that these CNNs cannot solve the distribution issue of the same magnetic field values. To remedy this limitation, there is a recent interest in applying CNNs to sequences of actual and past data, but no comparative studies have shown the performance contribution of this alternative. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based magnetic fingerprinting system using Recurrence Plots (RPs) as sequence fingerprints. To fairly compare the proposed system with an existing solution treating instantaneous magnetic data, the same real-world data in an indoor environment are used. Testing results show location classification accuracies of 94.92% and 95.46% for the cases of using one RP and three RPs, respectively.

low cost sensor with iot lorawan connectivity and machine learning-based calibration for air pollution monitoring,2021.0,5.0,"Air pollution poses significant risk to environment and health. Air quality monitoring stations are often confined to a small number of locations due to the high cost of the monitoring equipment. They provide a low fidelity picture of the air quality in the city; local variations are overlooked. However, recent developments in low-cost sensor technology and wireless communication systems like Internet of Things (IoT) provide an opportunity to use arrayed sensor networks to measure air pollution, in real time, at a large number of locations. This article reports the development of a novel low-cost sensor node that utilizes cost-effective electrochemical sensors to measure carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and an infrared sensor to measure particulate matter (PM) levels. The node can be powered by either solar-recharged battery or mains supply. It is capable of long-range, low power communication over public or private long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) IoT network and short-range high data rate communication over Wi-Fi. The developed sensor nodes were co-located with an accurate reference CO sensor for field calibration. The low-cost sensors' data, with offset and gain calibration, show good correlation with the data collected from the reference sensor. Multiple linear regression (MLR)-based temperature and humidity correction results in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 48.71% and R{2} of 0.607 relative to the reference sensor's data.

In the article, we are planning to implement three basic home appliances ac light fan and CC-TV by using ZigBee technology and cloud-based IoT. The user gives the voice command and it will be interpreted by the mobile using NLP. The mobile acts as a central support, and it decides what type of operation should be fulfilled by appliances according to the request of the user. It may be a Web application or smartphone application that helps us transfer the data to the cloud. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Home automation system; IoT; NLP; Voice control; ZigBee technology,"Mohapatra K., Nayak M., Nayak A.K.",Conference Paper,technique smart home automation nlp iot nowadays home automation go huge development technology design cost operate smart device strengthen greatly resident home aim develop voice control home appliance different type language use internet thing artificial intelligence ai nlp type automation appliance available market technology global mobile gsm bluetooth li system focus appliance try focus voice command mobile device help interpret command send message appliance article plan implement basic home appliance ac light fan cc tv zigbee technology cloud base iot user give voice command interpret mobile nlp mobile act central support decide type operation fulfil appliance accord request user web application smartphone application help transfer cloud editor(s applicable author(s exclusive license springer nature singapore pte ltd home automation iot nlp voice control zigbee technology
adaptive device-free localization in dynamic environments through adaptive neural networks,2021.0,5.0,"Device-free localization based on WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Many of the schemes are learning-based, among which CSI fingerprinting based on deep learning is the most promising. Learning-based schemes assume the distributions of CSI fingerprints keep relatively stable over time. However, this assumption often does not hold. As WiFi signals are prone to be influenced by various environmental factors, CSI fingerprints vary significantly with environmental changes. Consequently, the localization model built for the original environment degrades dramatically in the changed environment. Recalibrating the whole area of interest is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This is a major challenge of device-free WiFi localization. To mitigate this issue, we propose the method AdapLoc, aiming to adapt the original localization model to the changed environment with significantly reduced recalibration effort. AdapLoc is based on one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and exploits Domain Adaptation (DA) with Semantic Alignment (SA) to achieve adaptation. Extensive evaluations in four real-world single-link testbeds with multiple environmental changes demonstrate the effectiveness of AdapLoc in coping with localization in dynamic environments, outperforming the existing work with respect to localization and adaptation. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",Channel state information (CSI); convolutional neural network (CNN); device-free localization (DFL); domain adaptation (DA); semantic alignment (SA),"Zhou R., Hou H., Gong Z., Chen Z., Tang K., Zhou B.",Article,adaptive device free localization dynamic environment adaptive neural device free localization base channel state information csi attract considerable attention recent year scheme base csi fingerprinting base deep promising base scheme assume distribution csi fingerprint relatively stable time assumption hold signal prone influence environmental factor csi fingerprint vary significantly environmental change consequently localization model build original environment degrade dramatically change environment recalibrate area labor intensive time consume major challenge device free localization mitigate issue adaploc aim adapt original localization model change environment significantly reduce recalibration effort adaploc base dimensional convolutional neural 1d cnn exploit domain adaptation da semantic alignment sa achieve adaptation extensive evaluation real world single link testbed multiple environmental change demonstrate effectiveness adaploc cope localization dynamic environment outperform exist work respect localization adaptation channel state information csi convolutional neural cnn device free localization dfl domain adaptation da semantic alignment sa
object classification based on channel state information using machine learning,2021.0,0.0,"Wireless technologies have become more and more popular over the years. Today, Wi-Fi devices are used everywhere. This means that applied research on object recognition using Wi-Fi is relevant. This paper describes the classification of objects using channel state information (CSI). We use different machine learning methods, such as a decision tree, a support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors or a feed-forwarded neural net and others, which can be applied to the classification of physical objects. We explore the possibility of such recognition between Wi-Fi devices for various objects and study the effectiveness of various machine learning methods for recognizing objects using CSI. We also discuss the instability of CSI data due to drift over time which produces problems when using machine learning and consider the effectiveness of recognizing metal objects of various shapes at a short distance.

real-time human intrusion detection for home surveillance based on iot,2021.0,0.0,"Considering home security being more prominent nowadays, its proper surveillance and alerts at the right time warrant utmost importance. Our project focuses on an enhanced home security system that integrates the surveillance systems with powerful machine learning tools that guarantee a flawless responsible home safeguard system. To implement a real-time home security system for human intrusion detection, a remote monitoring video surveillance system based on Wi-Fi was developed. The video captured from the camera is further segmented and pre-processing techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and HAAR cascade algorithm are used for smartly eliminating false alarm due to animals. The former extract features from the input image whereas the latter is a cascade classifier that is used for identifying the objects in an image as propounded by Viola-Jones. The combination of these features is fed to SVM for multi-stage classification. The system then identifies the intruder automatically alerts the home resident and sends an alert message to the user’s mobile using IoT. In this chapter, the proposed work is implemented using Arduino, PIR sensor, wi-fi camera and evaluated in Python and Matlab2019. The power of this video surveillance system is efficiently enhanced with the use of proximity sensors.

evaluation and correction of smartphone-based fine time range measurements,2021.0,0.0,"Wi-Fi-based positioning technology has been recognised as a useful and important technology for location-based service (LBS) accompanied by the rapid development and application of smartphones since the beginning of the 21st century. However, no mature technology or method of Wi-Fi-based positioning had provided a satisfying output in the past 20 years, until recently, when the IEEE 802.11mc standard was released and hardware-supported in the market, in which a fine time measurement (FTM) protocol and multiple round-trip time (RTT) was used for more accurate and robust ranging without the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) involved. This paper provided an evaluation and ranging offset correction approach for Wi-Fi FTM based ranging. The characteristics of the ranging offset deviation errors are specifically examined through two well-designed evaluation tests. In addition, the offset deviation errors from a CompuLab WILD router and a Google access point (AP) are also compared. An average of 0.181 m accuracy was achieved after a typical offset correction process to the ranging estimates obtained from a complex surrounding environment with line-of-sight (LOS) condition.

modified indirect learning applied to neural network-based pre-distortion of a concurrent dual-band cmos power amplifier,2021.0,0.0,"Current radio communication systems that adopt amplitude and phase modulations demand high linearity and high efficiency. The cascade connection between digital baseband pre-distorter (DPD) and power amplifier (PA) can be a cost-effective solution to guarantee the required linearity without compromising the efficiency. In the design of a DPD for a single band PA, direct learning can be used to extract the pre-inverse parameters or, alternatively, indirect learning can be employed by exchanging the position of the system during the identification procedure to avoid the necessity of a PA model within a closed-loop process. The performance of direct learning is substantially dependent on the accuracy of the behavioral model that replaces the PA. Furthermore, in a practical environment where only an approximation to the inverse is achieved, the linearization capability of the indirect learning is affected by shifting the post-inverse placed after the PA to a pre-inverse located before the PA. For concurrent dual-band PAs, an additional advantage of the indirect approach is that the post-inverse identifications for each band are completely independent of each other. In an authors’ previous work, a comparative analysis between the two learning architectures applied to the linearization of concurrent dual-band PAs was performed based on DPDs modeled by polynomials with memory. This work contributions are the extension of such comparative analysis to DPDs modeled by artificial neural networks, the development of complex-valued three-layer perceptrons suitable for concurrent-dual band DPDs and the introduction of a modified indirect approach to improve the accuracy of previous direct and indirect learnings. Spectre-RF transient simulations are performed in the circuit-under-test described by a wideband 130 nm CMOS PA concurrently stimulated by 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and 3.5 GHz LTE signals. Reported simulation results show that, in a comparison with the previous direct and indirect learnings with similar output mean powers of about 60 mW, the modified indirect approach provides a superior linearity performance. The modified indirect learning reduces the error vector magnitude (EVM) metric to 0.87% and 1.13% for Wi-Fi and LTE bands, respectively, whereas the indirect and direct learnings achieve EVM equal to or larger than 1.05% and 1.49% for Wi-Fi and LTE bands, respectively. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Concurrent dual-band; Digital pre-distortion; Efficiency; Linearity; Power amplifier,"Schuartz L., Freire L.B.C., Hara A.T., Mariano A.A., Leite B., Lima E.G.",Article,modify indirect apply neural base pre distortion concurrent dual band cmos power amplifier current radio communication system adopt amplitude phase modulation demand high linearity high efficiency cascade connection digital baseband pre distorter dpd power amplifier pa cost effective solution guarantee require linearity compromise efficiency design dpd single band pa direct extract pre inverse parameter alternatively indirect employ exchange position identification procedure avoid necessity pa model closed loop process direct substantially dependent accuracy behavioral model replace pa furthermore practical environment approximation inverse achieve linearization capability indirect affect shift post inverse place pa pre inverse locate pa concurrent dual band pas additional advantage indirect approach post inverse identification band completely independent author previous work comparative architecture apply linearization concurrent dual band pas perform base dpds model polynomial memory work contribution extension comparative dpds model artificial neural development complex value layer perceptron suitable concurrent dual band dpds introduction modify indirect approach improve accuracy previous direct indirect learning spectre rf transient simulation perform circuit test describe wideband nm cmos pa concurrently stimulate 2.4 ghz 3.5 ghz lte signal report simulation result comparison previous direct indirect learning similar output mean power mw modify indirect approach provide superior linearity modified indirect reduce error vector magnitude evm metric 0.87 1.13 lte band respectively indirect direct learning achieve evm equal large 1.05 1.49 lte band respectively springer science+business medium llc springer nature concurrent dual band digital pre distortion efficiency linearity power amplifier
an improved particle filter based indoor tracking system via joint wi-fi/pdr localization,2021.0,5.0,"The development of indoor localization has been advanced by the rapid development of intelligent devices. The well-known methods used for indoor localization such as Wi-Fi fingerprint database positioning and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) can be implemented in a self-contained smartphone. However, the existing Wi-Fi fingerprint database positioning method can be easily influenced by the dynamic environment while PDR will generate a cumulative error with an increase in walking steps. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid method using PDR and Wi-Fi information. We divide the localization area into several subareas to improve the accuracy of the Wi-Fi fingerprint matching phase and introduce an enhanced particle filter (PF) algorithm which includes subarea information in the state vector and adopts a clonal selection algorithm (CSA) to improve resampling.

adversarial domain adaptation for network-based visible light positioning algorithm,2021.0,0.0,"Indoor positioning system (IPS) provides fundamental location-based service in indoor environment where GPS signal cannot reach. Different from WiFi, Bluetooth and other wireless signal based IPSs, visible light positioning (VLP) has been studied in recent years due to its high accuracy and robustness, and free from electromagnetic interference. Therefore, VLP is a promising technique in indoor public places such as hospital, airport, and shopping center. To achieve higher performance, deep learning has been widely investigated for VLP for its high tolerance to noise and studies have shown significant improvement in challenging environment compared to traditional algorithm such as least square. Unfortunately, we found that deep learning, or network-based algorithms are vulnerable to device heterogeneity and setup deviations for different users and environments, thus trained model may have poor performance in test stage. Besides, feature-label pair is often unavailable during testing for further model reinforcement. In this paper, an unsupervised learning method based on adversarial training is proposed for visible light network regressor. In this method, a feature extractor works to align feature distributions from different domains, while a domain classifier differentiates data from training set and test set. Results show that when multi-dimensional attack exists, our adversarial network model can achieve significant improvement than directly applying a trained model to the test set. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Adversarial training; Deep learning; Indoor positioning; Visible light positioning,"Hua L., Zhuang Y., Qi L., Yang J.",Conference Paper,adversarial domain adaptation base visible light positioning algorithm indoor positioning ips provide fundamental location base service indoor environment gps signal reach different bluetooth signal base ipss visible light positioning vlp study recent year high accuracy robustness free electromagnetic interference vlp promising indoor public place hospital airport shopping center achieve high deep widely investigate vlp high tolerance noise study show significant improvement challenging environment compare traditional algorithm square unfortunately find deep base algorithm vulnerable device heterogeneity setup deviation different user environment train model poor test stage feature label pair unavailable testing model reinforcement unsupervised base adversarial training propose visible light regressor feature extractor work align feature distribution different domain domain classifier differentiate training set test set result multi dimensional attack exist adversarial model achieve significant improvement directly apply train model test set editor(s applicable author(s exclusive license springer nature singapore pte ltd adversarial training deep indoor positioning visible light positioning

a hybrid information-based smartphone indoor-position approach,2021.0,1.0,"Indoor smartphone positioning is one of the key ICT techniques. Generally, the development and implementation of an indoor positioning system heavily relies on the technology of wireless sensor network (WSN) since wireless sensors can estimate the probable distance between radio source and the sensors themselves by evaluating the strengths of wireless signals, received from the radio source, such as RSSIs of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. However, the wireless signals could be influenced by indoor and outdoor objects, and carrying mode of a user’s smartphone, like in-pocket and in-backpack. Therefore, this study proposes an indoor positioning scheme, named LEarning-based Indoor Positing System (LEIPS), which identifies the carrying mode of a user’s smartphone by using this smartphone’s inertial sensors, aiming to increase the positioning accuracy of indoor positioning. Deep learning algorithms are also deployed by the LEIPS to improve the prediction performance. The experimental results demonstrate that this system can reach 99% of positioning accuracy.

neural network-based indoor localization system with enhanced virtual access points,2021.0,5.0,"Wi-Fi indoor positioning systems are based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements and fingerprinting, by matching measured data with the database.Hence, generation of RSSI fingerprint database is essential for a Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning system; this requires significant time and effort. The study utilizes virtual access points to increase the number of access points in an indoor environment without necessitating additional hardware. Increases in the total access points is advantageous because it makes the database more granular, and the Kriging algorithm is introduced to solve the issue with less effort. The study also aims to apply deep learning neural network (DNN) in Wi-Fi fingerprinting using RSSI.

gradual shrinkage of feature space using anova for wifi-based indoor localization,2020.0,1.0,"It is high time researchers realized the potential of statistical inference in setting expectations from features in prioritizing them. In this age of fanatic developments in artificial intelligence, no model would live up to satisfaction in case the features are dismal and insignificant. So, an insight into the significance of features may come to aid prior to delving into arduous hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we explore the problem of indoor localization and navigation-feeding to an eternal inquisitiveness of humans about where they are at some unknown venue-showing how inferential ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) can shed off noisy features. We utilize ANOVA for double-thresholding, with the first phase eliminating features with p-values >0.05 and the second round discarding features with F-ratios <70, across six indoor locations. This scaled down the feature-count from an initial 127 to an intermediate 125 to a final 50-making no compromise in accuracy or F1-score. We cross-validate the shrunk feature-set using kNN, assuming this will render more reliable metrics than neural networks for the purpose. The approach has shown extendibility to multiple classes and has enabled numerical quantification of the impact of each continuous feature-empowering the decision whether to retain the feature, to the alleviation of the curse of dimensionality. © 2020 IEEE.",ANOVA; F-ratio; indoor localization; inferential statistics,"Maitra S., Munia R.H., Rab A., Das Bapon A.",Conference Paper,gradual shrinkage feature space anova base indoor localization high time researcher realize potential statistical inference set expectation feature prioritize age fanatic development artificial intelligence model live satisfaction case feature dismal insignificant insight significance feature come aid prior delve arduous hyperparameter tuning explore problem indoor localization navigation feeding eternal inquisitiveness human unknown venue show inferential anova variance shed noisy feature utilize anova double thresholding phase eliminate feature p value > 0.05 second round discard feature f ratio < indoor location scale feature count initial intermediate final make compromise accuracy f1 score cross validate shrink feature set knn assume render reliable metric neural purpose approach show extendibility multiple class enable numerical quantification impact continuous feature empower decision retain feature alleviation curse dimensionality anova f ratio indoor localization inferential statistic
mimu,2020.0,0.0,"Mobile WiFi is a newly emerging service in recent years, which provides convenience for users to access online resources and increases revenues for operators via services such as advertisements and application promotions. However, in practice, the prohibitively high system implementation and operational costs, especially the costs of perpetual data traffic, hinder the further deployment of mobile WiFi services. In this paper, we present MIMU, a usage inference system for data traffic saving suitable for ubiquitous mobile WiFi services. We demonstrate the performance of the system via an example from the real-world nationwide edge computing mobile WiFi infrastructure. To address the impact of diverse user behaviors, we investigate the WiFi network usage from the perspective of users and devices, focusing on two unique features of mobile WiFi: user mobility regularity and access irregularity. In particular, we first design a deep learning-based two-dimension usage predictor to infer the future mobile WiFi usage with 1) a user dimension model with temporal attention addressing dominant users with heavy bus WiFi usage, and 2) a device dimension model with spatial attention addressing diverse WiFi usage and connection. Based on the results of the predictor, an application of content caching is implemented in an iterative fashion to save the data traffic. We evaluate MIMU by real-world bus WiFi system data sets of three major cities with 6,643 bus WiFi devices and 150k daily active users in total. Our results show that MIMU outperforms state-of-The-Art methods in terms of usage inference. Moreover, we summarize the lessons learned from our large-scale bus WiFi system investigation. © 2020 ACM.",Behavior; Bus WiFi; Deep Learning; Mobile Networks,"Qin Z., Xian Y., Zhang F., Zhang D.",Article,"mimu mobile newly emerge service recent year provide convenience user access online resource increase revenue operator service advertisement application promotion practice prohibitively high implementation operational cost especially cost perpetual traffic hinder deployment mobile service present mimu usage inference traffic save suitable ubiquitous mobile service demonstrate example real world nationwide edge compute mobile infrastructure address impact diverse user behavior investigate usage perspective user device focus unique feature mobile user mobility regularity access irregularity particular design deep base dimension usage predictor infer future mobile usage user dimension model temporal attention address dominant user heavy bus usage device dimension model spatial attention address diverse usage connection base result predictor application content caching implement iterative fashion save traffic evaluate mimu real world bus set major city 6,643 bus device 150k daily active user total result mimu outperform state art method term usage inference summarize lesson learn large scale bus investigation acm behavior bus deep mobile"
teaching rf to sense without rf training measurements,2020.0,2.0,"In this paper, we propose a novel, generalizable, and scalable idea that eliminates the need for collecting Radio Frequency (RF) measurements, when training RF sensing systems for human-motion-related activities. Existing learning-based RF sensing systems require collecting massive RF training data, which depends heavily on the particular sensing setup/involved activities. Thus, new data needs to be collected when the setup/activities change, significantly limiting the practical deployment of RF sensing systems. On the other hand, recent years have seen a growing, massive number of online videos involving various human activities/motions. In this paper, we propose to translate such already-Available online videos to instant simulated RF data for training any human-motion-based RF sensing system, in any given setup. To validate our proposed framework, we conduct a case study of gym activity classification, where CSI magnitude measurements of three WiFi links are used to classify a person's activity from 10 different physical exercises. We utilize YouTube gym activity videos and translate them to RF by simulating the WiFi signals that would have been measured if the person in the video was performing the activity near the transceivers. We then train a classifier on the simulated data, and extensively test it with real WiFi data of 10 subjects performing the activities in 3 areas. Our system achieves a classification accuracy of 86% on activity periods, each containing an average of 5.1 exercise repetitions, and 81% on individual repetitions of the exercises. This demonstrates that our approach can generate reliable RF training data from already-Available videos, and can successfully train an RF sensing system without any real RF measurements the proposed pipeline can also be used beyond training and for analysis and design of RF sensing systems, without the need for massive RF data collection. © 2020 ACM.",Human Activity Recognition; Machine Learning for RF Sensing; RF Sensing; RF Signal Processing; RF Simulation; WiFi,"Cai H., Korany B., Karanam C.R., Mostofi Y.",Article,teach rf sense rf training measurement novel generalizable scalable idea eliminate need collect radio frequency rf measurement train rf sensing system human motion relate activity exist base rf sensing system require collect massive rf training depend heavily particular sensing setup involve activity new need collect setup activity change significantly limit practical deployment rf sensing system hand recent year see grow massive number online video involve human activity
